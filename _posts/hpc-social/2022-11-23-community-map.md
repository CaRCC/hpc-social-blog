After an evening coding session, we are happy to announce that the community map (and associated automation) is live! This post will capture the screenshot of the first set of entries, which is what we wanted to write about. This was only announced days ago (and we only have a few entries) but we are taken aback by the (so far) geographic diversity of the HPC community! So far with a small number of entries, we are hitting the community in Europe, the United States, and even South America. This is awesome!
