title: Ceph OSD CPU Scaling - Part 1
---

<p>Last summer we had a user that hit some performance issues based on a recommendation to use 2 cores per OSD in their systems.  I wanted to provide some data for the community and wrote up a blog <a href="https://ceph.io/en/news/blog/2022/ceph-osd-cpu-scaling/">post</a> on the ceph.io website.  Please take a look!</p>
