title: Experimenting with Igor’s Bluestore WAL
---

<p>Igor Fedetov is one of the most knowledgable developers working on Ceph.  He’s started working on replacing our use of RocksDB’s write ahead log with a bluestore native implementation.  After tuning we can <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zETd1Nq_CbLNSh3R2II-z8efQizUjDYfHDBIcMwGNdg/edit?usp=sharing">achieve</a> up to 122K random write IOPS on a single OSD!  That’s nearly a 50% improvment over the current main branch and over twice as fast as Pacific!</p>
