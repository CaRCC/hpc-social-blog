title: On Random vs. Streaming I/O Performance; Or seek(), and You Shall Find ---
  Eventually.

<p>At the <a href="http://simpsonlab.github.io/blog/">Simpson Lab blog</a>, Iâ€™ve written a post
<a href="http://simpsonlab.github.io/2015/05/19/io-performance/">on streaming vs random access I/O performance</a>,
an important topic in bioinformatics. Using a very simple problem (randomly choosing lines in a 
non-indexed text file) I give a quick overview of the file system stack and what it means for
streaming performance, and reservoir sampling for uniform random online sampling.</p>
