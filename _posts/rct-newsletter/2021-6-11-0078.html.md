Miniroundup: how other readers have seen hybrid work; grant proposal for community code development

              <p>Hi, everyone!</p>

<p>Mainly taking the week off from the newsletter this week (for positive reasons - some family celebrations); things will return to normal next week.  But there were some things I wanted to share with you.</p>

<p>First, on the discussion from last week of planning for hybrid distributed/local work, we heard from long-time reader Adam DeConinck about what he’s learned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m fortunate at the moment, because my current team was fully remote before the pandemic started. That said, here are a few thoughts based on some of my recent experience.</p>

  <p>Several of my past roles have already been “hybrid”, where either some employees were remote vs some not; or where employees were split across many offices in multiple time zones, which often led to similar communication challenges.</p>

  <p>The general philosophy that has seemed to work has been to split “location” by team. I.e., everyone on a team should either be remote, or should be co-located in the same office. This basically works to allow each team to find their rhythm.</p>

  <p>In the cases where teams have been split across different work “locations”, I’ve mostly seen the effective formation of “sub-teams”. E.g., while the [city X] and [city Y] offices may in theory both have members on the same team, they tend to split responsibilities to minimize overlap. Or, if there’s a core group in the office but a few remote folks, the remote team members form their own “team” where they mostly collaborate with each other.</p>

  <p>Based on this experience, I suspect organizations which are large enough to have a lot of teams will go through substantial re-orgs over the next year!</p>

  <p>Granted, this is a lot harder for orgs where there are fewer teams, or where they’re smaller or harder to split. In those cases, unless everyone can make it back into the office, I think the only thing that works is to go the “remote first” model: everyone works as if they were remote, joining video calls individually and putting most communication in text. And then in-office interaction is purely social.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is really valuable; thanks, Adam!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I also heard from readers whose institutions are decidedly <em>not</em> moving to hybrid or remote work but instead expect everyone back as soon as possible.  In a way that’s a lot easier, but it certainly ties a hiring managers hands behind their backs in recruiting new hires, or retaining those who have come to like not having to commute every day.</p>

<p>If your team manages systems, you’ve probably heard about the really pretty bad privilege-escalating <a href="https://github.blog/2021-06-10-privilege-escalation-polkit-root-on-linux-with-bug/">polkit vulnerability</a> that affects RHEL8, Fedora 21+, Debian testing, and Ubuntu 20.04  If you haven’t, you’ll want to update (a fix was released last week). The post is a really detailed overview of the bug and the proof of concept exploit.</p>

<p>Titus Brown generously shared the core of a <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) Essential Open Source Software for Science</a> grant application in a blog post which you can read <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2021-sourmash-czi-application.html">here</a>; the proposal aims to make their package sourmash more of a community code by moving towards more community engagement.</p>

<p>The post is interesting both if you’re interested in CZI grants but also to see how a PI quite experienced in research software development thinks about building community engagement.</p>

<p>As a side note I’d love to see more research computing and data grant proposals being made public!</p>

<hr />

<p>There’s a call for papers due on Monday, 14 June, for a workshop on <a href="https://www.csm.ornl.gov/srt/conferences/Resilience/2021/">Resilience in HPC Clusters, Clouds, and Grids</a>; the workshop is held in conjunction with <a href="https://2021.euro-par.org">Euro-Par 2021</a>, to be held on-site in Lisbon.</p>

<hr />

<p>And that’s it for this mini-roundup.  Please keep feedback coming in, and welcome to all new readers.</p>

<p>Have a great weekend, and good luck in the coming week with your research computing team!</p>
