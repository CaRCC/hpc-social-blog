title: '#16 - How To Quickly Start One-on-Ones with your Research Computing Team-
  A One-Week Plan of Action'
---

<p>Hi, everyone:</p>

<p>Sorry for the off-cycle email.</p>

<p>A lot of us are trying to figure out how to manage our teams now that we’re not all working in the same space. I’ve written about one-on-ones before; if you’re already doing them, they will help you stay connected with your teammates over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>If you aren’t, I’ve put together a one-week plan to get started doing one-on-ones with your newly-remote research computing team. For each weekday, there’s about 20 minutes total of reading plus homework to do to get you started doing one-on-ones with your team starting one week from when you begin. There’s follow-up activities in weeks two and three to take stock, make tweaks, and start thinking about tools that will help.</p>

<p>I’ll circulate it more widely soon, but I want newsletter subscribers to have access to it first.  It’s all posted <a href="https://www.dursi.ca/post/quickstart-remote-one-on-ones.html">here</a> in one document.</p>

<p>It’s a long read — the whole week plus followups in one place.  I’ll also add a signup form so you can get it sent to you in email form one days’ worth at a time, and I’ll make it available as an ebook as well.</p>

<p>I hope this is useful; reply and let me know if you have any comments or questions.</p>

<p>Talk to you again on Friday with the regular link round up.</p>

<p>Best wishes to you and  your team,</p>

<p>Jonathan</p>
