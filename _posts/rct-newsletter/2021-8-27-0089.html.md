              <p>Hi, everyone:</p>

<p>I hope that as the start of the academic year approaches in the northern hemisphere, those of you who are going back to campus are comfortable doing so, and supported by administration.</p>

<p>Thanks to community members volunteering, we have a small core of 4-5 people who will start helping with resources for the community making suggestions to guide the newsletter.  If you have suggestions, or want to take part, just hit reply or  <a href="mailto:jonathan@researchcomputingteams.org">email me</a>.</p>

<p>And now, on to the roundup:</p>

<h2 id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>

<p><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2021/08/19/the-3-stay-conversations-to-improve-employee-retention/?utm_source=email">The 3 Stay Conversations: The Best Way To Improve Employee Retention</a> - Know Your Team, Clare Lew<br />
<a href="https://hypercontext.com/blog/meetings/offboarding-meeting">The Final One-on-One: 7 Questions to ask When Offboarding Employees</a> - Anita Chauhan, Hypercontext</p>

<p>After 18 months of pandemic, with everyone tired while tech industry <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/demand-for-developers-is-at-a-rocketing-and-employers-struggling-to-hire/">employee demand and salaries are skyrocketing</a>, incautious research computing team managers risk losing their most ambitious, high-performing, team members.</p>

<p>In the first article, Lew lists three sets of conversations to routinely have with team members during one-on-ones:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clarifications about the team member and their work (what has motivated them, is it clear why what they do in particular matters, are there skills of theirs not being used)</li>
  <li>Questions around team dynamics (do they wish they were interacting with another part of the team more, do they like the current level of interactions, how do they like to be recognized for their work)</li>
  <li>Questions about organizational context (are there areas of the org they wish they knew more about, what has been confusing lately, is the vision clear).</li>
</ol>

<p>These seem like great detailed questions to ask periodically.  It might usefully be augmented by very frequent high-level open-ended check-ins.  For instance, with manager-tools <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/04/employee-retention">employee retention question</a> - “Hey, overall, how’s it going?” - asked routinely in one-on-ones, as a way of detecting whether your team members have any issues or concerns which might lead them to having their <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/shields-down/">shields down</a> to other opportunities.</p>

<p>If people do leave, we should celebrate that - growth and development and moving to new roles is good and healthy - even if it’s a pain for us.  In addition, a team member leaving can be a good time to get some unvarnished feedback if you’ve spent the time together building a good working relationship.  Chauhan recommends some questions, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there anything we should be aware of as we take over your responsibilites?</li>
  <li>If we could improve, how would we do it?</li>
  <li>Did the job live up to your expectations?</li>
  <li>What was the most enjoyable part of your job?</li>
  <li>What qualities and skills should someone have to be succesful in your role?</li>
  <li>Who do you feel is doing an outstanding job on the team?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://codingsans.com/blog/performance-review?utm_source=Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=128">Performance Review: Build Your Process and Master Feedback Delivery</a> - Gábor Zöld and Lara Hogan, Coding Sans</p>

<p>In my institution it’s annual review time - it’s a pretty lightweight process here.  It might actually be too lightweight - a manager who isn’t routinely giving their team members direct feedback could easily skate through this review process with some platitudes and go an entire year without ever giving their team members any useful information about how they are doing.  On the other hand, massive annual processes cause their own pain, if only through non-compliance.</p>

<p>In a field as quickly-shifting as research computing, setting goals annually requires unfeasible powers of prognostication.  I like setting and reviewing goals for work, skill development, and career development every 3-4 months - our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/150SVAio4xbrkxKInzvEGxm8WyREIsnOeTypYP0xsrrI/edit">template form is here</a>.   New managers: you are not as limited by official HR processes as you likely believe!  Your HR business associate would be delighted to hear that you’re setting goals and reviewing progress with your team members <em>more often</em> than the bare minimum enforced by policy<em>.</em></p>

<p>Regardless - however you and your institution organize performance review processes, it’s important for the team for expectations setting, an important lever and responsibility for you as a manager, and a stressful time for your team members.  In this blog post coming out of a podcast episode, Hogan gives a detailed walk through of her approach to the process; it’s a terrific discussion.  She covers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting input from stakeholders and synthesizing it</li>
  <li>Provide what they need to make any improvements they need to make</li>
  <li>What should go in a performance review - no surprises, super specific points, focus on behaviours, what would need to be changed, and why</li>
  <li>How to prepare for giving the feedback</li>
  <li>How to present the report</li>
</ul>

<p>With a bonus of how to prepare to receive feedback when its your turn.</p>

<p>Hogan makes an important point early on - none of your feedback given in a performance review should ever be a surprise.  You’re their manager - you can, and have the responsibility to, give them timely feedback as needed; the purpose of the review process is to synthesize and memorialize that feedback and make plans together as to next steps.  She also emphasizes connecting the feedback to things they care about, such as career development goals.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of good material here, and it’s worth going through if you’ll be giving a performance review any time soon - or even if you’re not but you’d like to up your performance expectations conversation skills.</p>

<p><a href="https://demystifying-public-speaking.com">Demystifying Public Speaking</a> - Lara Hogan</p>

<p>A lot of us who came up through research tend to no longer focussing on giving good presentations, because after all - we gave a million presentations about our work.  We’re old hands.</p>

<p>But the presentations we’re asked to give leading research computing teams are very different than the extremely specific sub-genre that is academic presentations, which are mostly teaching people who are already experts about some new work we’ve recently done.  We’re usually making cases for particular actions, or giving status reports, or training, all the while speaking to a very broad audience.   Also - look, the quality/interestingness bar set for academic presentations is pretty dire.</p>

<p>Hogan’s book is a simple overview of giving more general-purpose presentations.  Several sections of this book - choosing a topic and a venue, getting over pre-talk jitters, what to pack and bring on talk day - will in fact be old hat to veterans of the academic colloquium circuit.   But sections 4 and 5 on crafting the structure of the talk, arranging post-talk resources, practicing and getting feedback before, and taking notes afterwards of what worked and what didn’t, are useful, especially for people who haven’t thought critically about this since grad school.</p>

<p>Making decisions as a manager is scary, and it gets harder as your responsibilities grow.  In this very sympathetic article for decision-makers, Lopp has some recommendations for you once you think you have a decision:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check your work - are there aspects of the situation you haven’t thought about?  Are there other options?</li>
  <li>Ask for help  - from the team, and from your peers</li>
  <li>Slow down - most decisions are less urgent than they seem</li>
  <li>What if I’m wrong - make sure you understand what will happen if the decision is the wrong one (it’s often not as scary as it sounds)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/confusing-explanations/">Patterns in confusing explanations</a> - Julia Evans</p>

<p>We do a lot of training and other explaining to broad communities - perhaps in presentations, as above! - and it’s important to have clear explanations.</p>

<p>Evans, who writes <em>extremely</em> clear explanations on a range of technical topics, often about things she’s recently learned herself, has seen a list of common anti-patterns in explanations she’s read on technical topics, and lists them here with some examples and better ways.   I’ve paraphrased the list for stand-alone summary purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Making outdated or internally-inconsistent assumptions about the audiences knowledge</li>
  <li>Strained analogies</li>
  <li>Mismatch between dry explanations and “fun” illustrations</li>
  <li>Unrealistic examples</li>
  <li>Meaningless jargon</li>
  <li>Too many concepts introduced all at once</li>
  <li>Starting out with abstractions or concepts before getting to concrete needs (we are <em>terrible</em> about this in academia and tech), but also</li>
  <li>Explaining the what without the why at all</li>
  <li>Unsupported statements</li>
  <li>Explaining the “wrong” way without first saying its wrong - shreds trust of the rader</li>
</ul>

<p>but if you’re at all interested in improving the explanations you and your team share in anything from documentation to presentations to downtime announcements to anything else, this is a good starting point.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> is now officially generally available, and provides an entire forum -  with Q&amp;A and open discussions, pin announcements, enable moderation, grant higher permissions to frequent contributors, create polls, for your users, and more.  You can convert issues into discussion topics, too.</p>

<p>Have any readers started doing this for their projects?  It seems a lot easier than setting up a slack or something for community feedback, and a lot easier for a potential new user to participate in than filing an issue.</p>

<p>This is written as advice to candidates to ask their hiring managers in interviews, but they are also a good set of questions for research software development teams should ask themselves and have ready as good answers (or unsolicited information) for incoming candidates before they start hiring.</p>

<p>Stringer’s questions cover working with the code, working with the team, working with the users, and the product(s) as a whole:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Working with the code - how do developers locally build and test the software, how is CI/CD setup</li>
  <li>Working with the team - how is the team structured, what meetings and rituals are there, what communications tools do they use, who is available for beginner quetsions</li>
  <li>Working with the users - how does feedback work, what support requirements are there, where is the documentation</li>
  <li>Working on the product - what are high-level issues with the existing software, where are stakeholders focussed, what is the release cycle</li>
</ul>

<p>A candidate who is given all of this information at once, before hiring or as part of onboarding material, would have a lot of confidence that they’re joining a team that has their stuff together.</p>

<p><a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2021/08/21/the-big-load-anti-pattern/">The big-load anti-pattern</a> - Daniel Lemire</p>

<p>The obvious and easy thing to do when processing a lot of data is to load it all in memory.  Sometimes this is the only feasible approach unless you want to do a lot of work, as Lemire points out it scales poorly even if the machine you’re using has the necessary memory  - with the simplest possible example, Lemire shows a slowdown of 3-4x going from 1MB to 1GB, and 1GB isn’t a tonne of data.  All of the caching infrastructure of your system, from disk to RAM to CPU, works better and faster with processing small chunks of data at a time.</p>

<p>Lemire recommends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make use of chunking that is almost certainly implemented in whatever readers you are using</li>
  <li>split the data, by horizontal (rows) or vertical (columns) shards</li>
  <li>make use of compression, and compress small chunks</li>
</ul>

<p>HPC hasn’t been alone since at least 2009 in trying to manage <a href="https://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/10.2200/S00874ED3V01Y201809CAC046">single computing systems that are datacenter-sized</a>.</p>

<p>“Smart NICs” offloading some computation - like MPI collective aggregations - to the network cards have been available for some time.  But there are increasingly stringent needs.  This article provides a nice quotable fact via Intel - Google and Facebook claim that anywhere from 22% to 80% of CPU usage from many micro service workloads go to infrastructure handling, like network security (IPSec, TLS), networking control (traffic management and shaping), etc.</p>

<p>Hyperscalers like AWS and Azure have been pushing these functions to their own hand-rolled network cards developed with ASICs or FPGAs, but demand is growing enough that NIC vendors are looking to turn these into products.  It’s not straightforward - handling these tasks at line speeds while speeds increase requires significantly more compute power, and programmability. The result is what everyone else is calling DPUs, and intel is calling IPUs because it used DPUs for something else.</p>

<p>The IEEE Hot Chips conference had a session on these units from ARM/Marvell, NVIDIA, and Intel, and Russel here helpfully summarizes and compares the plans.</p>

<p>Interestingly, all the DPUs are ARM based, even Intel’s.  As is required for application offload, they’re all quite programmable.  The aims are impressive - 400-800 Gbps ethernet, with switching, security and QoS at line speeds, direct memory access with ROCEv2, and more.</p>

<p>This is a good overview of products coming down the line and if you’re interested the summary and links to other materials is a good starting point.</p>

<p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/eats-safety-team-on-call-overview/">Eats Safety Team On-Call Overview</a> - Eduardo David and Josh Kline, Uber Engineering Blog</p>

<p>An important requirement for reliable systems is a well-defined set of responsibilities for being on-call outside of regular working hours.  It doesn’t necessarily have to be onerous, depending on what the reliability goals are, but if you want to avoid people stressing out over things that don’t matter, or being too lax over things that do, or not knowing what is whose job, there has to be something explicitly written down.</p>

<p>This post by David and Kline is a nice, short, and unusually specific writeup of how Uber Eats handles on-call:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Definitions of on-call teams; a primary responder, a secondary responder (presumably in smaller teams we could make this less of a responsibility and more of a back-up) and a defined role for a “shadow” for onboarding/training</li>
  <li>Alert notification policy, saying how alerts are commuincated (and escelated)</li>
  <li>The rotation schedule</li>
  <li>Before on-call preparation checklist</li>
  <li>After on-call handoff meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>What I found most interesting is the hand-off meeting, and on-call quality metrics.  The goal is to make on-call as reasonable as possible, and that means <em>not</em> getting paged for stuff that can wait until morning, or that the paged person can’t do anything about.  It also means having high-quality runbacks so if there are things that need to be fixed, it’s clear to the on call team what needs to be done.  So they collect data from the on-call team about exactly these items, so they can improve things.</p>

<p>(Interestingly - they are using this blogpost in part as a recruiting tool.  “Look how reasonable our on-call is, and how we work to improve it. Hey, we’re hiring”.   There’s a lesson in there for our teams.)</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06271">Playing with a Quantum Computer</a> - Rainer Müller, Franziska Greinert, arXiv 2108.06271</p>

<p>Even 15 years ago, this would be a pretty fantastical sentence: The authors of this paper show how to use freely-available real quantum computers as teaching labs for undergraduate physics courses.</p>

<p><a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com">IBM Quantum</a> and <a href="https://www.quantum-inspire.com">Quantum Inspire</a> have free tiers, and other cloud providers have free tiers which can be used for their quantum simulators which allow one to develop against the APIs that are used for their quantum computing resources.</p>

<p>There are a number of classic quantum algorithms - Shor’s algorithm for factorization which is complicated, or the artificial but simple Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm determining if an algorithm returns binary constants or 50/50 ones and zeros.  Müller and Greinert, for their purposes, want something that is both relatively straightforward to program in a gate-baed quantum computer but also interesting and easy to reason about for undergrads.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>The “Coin Flip” game is a not-very-interesting game where two players have a penny in (say) a heads-up state, each determine their move (flip or not-flip) a penny, and player 2 wins if it ends up heads else player one wins.    In David A Meyer’s Quantum Coin Flip game, the coin is a quantum bit in the</td>
      <td>0&gt; state, classical player 1 is limited to the classical flip or no-flip moves, and quantum player 2 can “move” by applying an arbitrary unitary transform to the qubit.  In this game, the quantum player has a move that will always win.  (“Unlike Bob, Alice knows the laws of quantum physics and is able to perform all conceivable quantum operations on the qubit.”)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Programming (here in IBM’s quantum composer) the winning strategy is relatively straightforward, it helps demonstrate both unitary transformations and measurement by projecting onto the 0/1 states, and (helpfully, pedagogically) it demonstrates a state of affairs that’s completely impossible for the classical version of the game, where there is no winning strategy.</p>

<p>We often talk about research computing as a way of simulating experiments of physical systems - this is the first time I believe we’ve described a situation where the research computing environment actually is a physical undergraduate laboratory of the actual system.</p>

<p>Lower-precision calculations in HPC aren’t new - multi-precision methods come up often in the literature of the late 90s and early 2000s, when the use of smaller floats for parts of the calculation started looking attractive as memory bandwidth started to play a larger role in technical computation.</p>

<p>But those methods are more complicated and subtle than just using double for everything, and until AI started really driving hardware efficiency advances (and awareness) on FP32, FP16, and BF16 computations, most felt it wasn’t worth it.</p>

<p>The article by Hemsoth highlights recent work done by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (<a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/media-centre/news/2021/forecast-upgrade-innovates-single-precision-and-ensemble-resolution">ECMWF</a>) and <a href="https://www.essoar.org/pdfjs/10.1002/essoar.10507472.2">others</a> on using lower-precision calculations in climate and weather calculations.  Both the fully-fledged weather forecast simulations (showing forecast tracks of a hurricane) and shallow-water calculations show significant performance increases with lower-precision and compensation, and perfectly acceptable accuracy:</p>
