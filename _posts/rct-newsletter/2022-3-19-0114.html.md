<p>Hi!</p>

<p>It’s been pointed out I have my view of the role of specialization in
research computing teams seems a bit contradictory. I am very pro-specialization,
but anti-siloing.  Fair point!  Let’s dig more into that.</p>

<p>No research computing and data team can do everything.  It’s not possible.
Pretending otherwise leads to unhappy team members and unsatisfied
researchers.  And as I like to point out, there’s already tonnes of computing
things our teams don’t do for researchers. We don’t help them with their
printers, or lay out designs of posters for conferences.  So my advice is
wherever possible — and it’s more possible than you think — is to add a
few things to that list.  To niche down into a specialization.</p>

<p>The most meaningful specialization is of the form of “we help [community]
with [problem]”.  One very effective way to do that is where community
is a particular discipline (defined broadly). “We help wet lab molecular
biologists with their bioinformatics analyses”. “We help social sciences
researchers with their GIS software development needs”. “We help researchers
with long term data retention needs affordably and reliably store and share
their data”. “We help health scientists write and deploy desktop and mobile
data collection applications”. “We help researchers new to quantitative
methods with data science”.  “We help researchers with web applications
deploy, operate and maintain their application stacks”.</p>

<p>There are a lot of advantages of such a specialization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It lets your team get stronger, faster.  Team members can go very deep into both understanding particular community needs and the details of a problem domain, building their skills quickly.</li>
  <li>It lets your team get more efficient, as your teams build components of solutions that can be reused.</li>
  <li>It helps you recruit researcher clients more easily, because it’s very easy for them to understand what you can help with, and to recommend you to others in their community.</li>
  <li>It helps you recruit the right kind of staff more easily, because it’s very easy for them to understand what you do and why they’d want to work there.</li>
  <li>It helps you communicate your value to decision makers in your institutions (or amongst your funders) and demonstrate alignment with their priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>A decent sized team could potentially have two or three of those
specializations, aligned either along the community or problem axes, and
still be sharply focussed.  It starts to look like a core facility, which
faculty, institutional decision makers, and funders all instinctively
understand.</p>

<p>A significantly weaker and less meaningful form of specialization is,
unfortunately, a little easier to fall into.  It’s more inward looking and
input based rather than focused on researchers and their needs.  It’s to lean
on the tools you use.  To focus shallowly on the activities you perform. “We
write C++ code for research”.  “We run a cluster researchers can use”.</p>

<p>There are three big problems with this approach.</p>

<p>The first is with communicating your existence to researchers at all, much
less attracting them as clients.  Few researchers have a problem they think
of as primarily a C++ problem, or a running-cluster problem.  By and large,
they have (say) functionality they want to add to a groundwater data analysis
code, or the need to run an ensemble of simulation-analysis pipelines.  Maybe
C++ or a particular kind of cluster is one of the tools that can be used to
solve their problem, and if so, great!  But there are likely other options
they could be using, too.  (Do you doubt me about finding researchers?  Because
I’ve been on several function-specific teams which were “the only game in
town” at particular institutions, and we were constantly <em>shocked</em> at how
many researchers had just never heard of us.)</p>

<p>The second is in having those researchers value your work.  If you provide
undifferentiated C++ programming or cluster administration, you’ll always do
a worse job for that particular researcher than a team that did software
development specifically for subsurface science, or a computing resource that
can queue complex simulation-analysis-pipeline workloads.  There will always
be researchers who <em>can</em> take advantage of the undifferentiated offering, but
they’ll be the ones who could just as easily move elsewhere the moment the
opportunity arose.  They won’t develop any particular relationship with the
team nor advocate strongly for the team in particular.</p>

<p>The third is communicating your value to decision makers, funders, or potential
staff members.  “We write C++ research software”, “we run a big cluster” isn’t
a compelling story.  If you back it up with undifferentiated statistics -
which is all you can really offer - even less so.  “We completed 15 projects
last year!”.  So?  Is that a lot?  A little?  How did that move a field
forward?  “We run at 91% utilization!”.  Is that good?  Bad?  How did that
help the University?  You can try to beat the drum for case studies and
high-impact publications resulting from the inputs.  But it’s always going
to be an uphill battle trying to get research groups to write them up or even
bother notifying you about their paper.  It’s hard because you’re running an
undifferentiated resource, one they could replace if necessary.  Writing
something up for you is just one more low-priority item for the todo list.</p>

<p>Still, there’s a reason why this approach is common amongst teams to organize
around - we’ll come back to it in a moment.</p>

<p>Because there’s <em>an even worse</em> way to “specialize”, and I see worrying trends
of it happening as countries and regions rightly start taking research computing
and data more seriously.   And that’s by “pillars” (read silos) - software,
data, and infrastructure.</p>

<p>This approach <em>kind of</em> made sense in the 90s or early 2000s.  Systems were
getting increasingly homogenous, software was all of a certain kind (3d
physical simulations) that ran on those systems.  Data teams if they existed
at all were separate entirely, focussed on different users, in business schools
or social sciences, and were all SAS/SPSS/whatever and SQL.  There wasn’t
much overlap.</p>

<p>Historically teams tended to be broken up that way, and that’s the genesis
of most of today’s research computing teams in Universities.  “Because we’ve
always done it that way” caries a lot of weight in old institutions.  And you
see their legacy still.</p>

<p>Today, if you were starting from scratch, you’d never organize teams around
those functions.  It’s absurd.  Everything in our field today is a combination
of the three facets of research computing and data.  The “data collection
tools for health researchers”, for instance, is a combination of infrastructure
(deployment of a backend), data management (handling sensitive data), and
software development (the application itself).  Bioinformatics is inherently
software + data.</p>

<p>The increasingly unified, cross-function nature of such work is a challenge
even for your faithful correspondent.  Take a look at the articles in the
data management section this week, for instance - CI/CD pipelines for data
artifacts.  Is that an infra thing, a software thing, or data management?
How about cloud-friendly libraries for geospatial data?  How about data
analysis toolkits in the browser?  Which section should those go in</p>

<p>For organizing a newsletter roundup it can still be helpful to bin articles
by which facet is most distinctive, and mis-binning is mostly harmless.</p>

<p>If you’re deciding on how to fund efforts, however, the stakes are much higher!
In that case, you really need to consider everything holistically, and binning
into silos is a terrible idea.  Data without software is useless, as is
software that’s not deployed anywhere, as is a compute infrastructure with
no storage.   Even in the 90s, the best software teams were very aware of the
systems their tools would run on and coded accordingly, and the systems teams
were very aware of their workloads.  Having the teams communicate across silo
boundaries was something the best teams did.  Both sides needed to know what
was implementable. Organizing funding by silo right from the beginning makes
that cross-silo communication <em>much</em> harder.</p>

<p>We as human beings need to organize <em>somehow,</em> though - we can’t communicate
with everyone else in research computing and data equally.  The highest impact
teams I’ve seen (and, not coincidentally, the ones that are least worried
about their funding in the coming years) are those that have a specific focus,
usually disciplinary (mirroring the research community focus they support),
and have cross-functional expertise in their team.  They have enough knowledge
to help a researcher see a problem through beginning to end.  The researchers
see them as partners, and will advocate for them.  And that’s because they’ve
organized themselves around what they’re <em>supporting</em>, particular kinds of
projects, rather than internally focussed on a tool they use.</p>

<p>Does that line up with what you see on the ground?  Are their other ways of
specializing or organizing that you’ve seen work?  Email me with that or with

<p>With that, on to the roundup!</p>

<h2 id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>

<p><a href="https://matt-schellhas.medium.com/the-uninspiring-manager-e2e2e752ab24">The Uninspiring Manager</a> - Matt Schellhas</p>

<p>Too much of what I imagined an excellent manager should be early
in my career (not having really seen any) was focussed on personal
characteristics.  Such leaders should be engaging, people-persons…
and inspiring.</p>

<p>It’s not that any of those things is bad, of course.  Those are all
traits and behaviours that can be put to good use as a manager or
lead!  But so can the default behaviours of quiet, attentive,
carefully-thinks-before-speaking introverts.  Or of
keep-ticking-things-off-the-list achievers.  Or of caring, emotionally
intuitive, confidantes.  Each has default behaviours that are
extremely helpful in the right circumstance, and are downright
liabilities in others.</p>

<p>Schellhas makes the case against needing to be inspiring to be a
good manager.  In his view, people mostly already <em>want</em> to do a
good job, and what they need to accomplish that is: information;
skill; and willpower.</p>

<p>Inspiration doesn’t help at all with the first two, and only
temporarily for the third.  A better use of energy than temporarily
<em>boosting</em> willpower with some rah rah stuff, he says, would be to
put effort into fixing willpower-<em>sapping</em> features of the job.
Fixing flaky CI systems that make writing tests seem useless, or
removing unnecessary reporting.</p>

<p>One thing Schellhas doesn’t call out that I’ll add - being able to
communicate a clear vision for the team <em>is</em>, in my estimation, a
requirement of the job.  People need to know what they are aiming
for, and how their work fits into that.  And that vision might even
be inspiring!  But that inspiration best comes from the work and
goals themselves, not from some charismatic leader.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="https://lethain.com/trunk-and-branches/">Trunk and Branches Model for Scaling Infrastructure Organizations</a> - Will Larson</p>

<p>Larson here is talking specifically about infrastructure teams.  But this
could apply to growing research computing and data teams.</p>

<p>The constraints are keeping the core operations of an initial team with a
broad remit going while growing and adding capabilities.  The model he
recommends and has seen work is to grow slowly and, as particular well-defined
areas start emerging as being important, to “bud off” a branch sub-team with
that specialty while the “trunk” team continues on with reduced scope.   In
our context, this could be two officially different teams with different
managers/leads, or, maybe less ideally, overlapping groups of competence
within a single large team.</p>

<p>(By the way, this is all perfectly consistent with beginning with a team that
already has a well-defined specialty - GIS data science or web/mobile apps
for data collection or managing clusters for AI/ML workloads.  The wonderful
thing about research, and expertise in general, is that it’s fractal.  No
matter how small a chunk of the big picture you start with, as you zoom further
in you see more and more complexity.  You discover whole new parts of the map
to explore and become knowledgeable in.)</p>

<p>The key things Larson emphasizes here is to be clear (internally and externally)
about what who owns what responsibilities as a team branches off.</p>

<hr />

<p>I really like this <a href="https://eng-hiring.18f.gov">documented hiring process</a>
by 18F in the US Government.  It’s a well thought out process, and it’s written
in a way that you could send to candidates so they know exactly what to expect.
It’s even <a href="https://github.com/18F/eng-hiring">in GitHub</a>.  I also really like
their <a href="https://eng-hiring.18f.gov/pre-work/">technical pre-work</a> - it’s either
to provide some code they’ve worked on, or to do one of four exercises.  The
exercises are simple but non-trivial get-and-process-data exercises that would
give a lot more confidence about ability to do real programming tasks than
some kind of fizz-buzz.</p>

<h2 id="managing-your-own-career">Managing Your Own Career</h2>

<p><a href="https://untools.co/minto-pyramid">Minto Pyramid</a> - Adam Amran, Untools</p>

<p>Amran gives a very clear formula here for emails that you also see in advice
for briefing boards (or in our case, <em>e.g</em>., scientific advisory committee.).
Start with a one-sentence paragraph of the conclusion (or the ask); then a
listing of the key arguments; then the supporting details.  I’d add that the
subject line should reflect the conclusion/ask.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about this recently.  I’m generally ok about writing
to-the-point, skimmable emails.  But that skill may have atrophied a bit
recently.  In my previous job, I didn’t send a lot of emails (we used slack
internally mostly).  When I did send them, as a manager and as a big fish in
a small pond, I… could kind of assume my emails would be carefully read.  In
retrospect I kind of got lazy and leaned on that, which I now feel sheepish
about.</p>

<p>I’m in now an individual contributor in a <em>very</em> email-heavy organization.
I can see very clearly the effects of getting lazy about sending bottom-line-up-front
emails.  I’ve tried to communicate some points via email to some very busy
account managers in the past couple weeks, and some of the points just did
not get across.  So it’s time to up my game again.</p>

<p>Not every email lends itself to this formula, of course, but sticking to
bottom-line-up-front is a good general principle.</p>

<p>Journal clubs can be great.  The usual failure mode is that few
other than the presenter actually reads the paper in any depth, so
there’s not much discussion afterwards.</p>

<p>Fillon ranks the journal club mechanisms he’s seen work the best.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the session will cover one paper, have everyone read the paper and on game day randomly assign explaining one figure to each of the participants.  That way everyone is, um, “incentivized” to have read the paper ahead of time.</li>
  <li>Alternately, have each person cover one paper, curated from a list of thematically-linked papers.  The discussion of each paper will necessarily be a little shallow, but this will let you really go over an area of research.</li>
</ul>

<p>There has been and will continue to be a huge influx of research money into
health, but the past few years have been really rough on cancer reseach.  Not
only is it no longer anyone’s #1 health research priority, a lot of the
research funds comes from charitable giving which the pandemic-related recession
hit hard.</p>

<p>NCRI reports a drop of 9% of funding, which doesn’t sound like much but the
majority of funding spending is on salaries.  No doubt infectious disease
research rose at least as much in absolute numbers, but people with years of
training and expertise can’t be repurposed as easily as dollars can.</p>

<p>In general I think the coming years are going to see increasing changes from
the pre-2020 baseline research funding landscape.</p>

<p>AI <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/03/why-ai-failed-to-live-up-to-its-potential-during-the-pandemic">did not cover itself in glory over the past two years of COVID</a>, and neither I’d argue did HPC - while bread-and-butter high-throughput computing and on-the-desktop bioinformatics workflows were invaluable.</p>

The merger implied a total of 150 solar masses of black holes involved, which is a weird number - most black holes are either a few to a couple dozen times solar, or much more massive.  Even weirder, a month later there was a big flash in the area.</p>

<p>In the paper by Samsing <em>et al.</em>, the ensemble of simulations showed that adding a third black hole increases the odds of eccentric orbits by two orders of magnitude (and accounts for the observed strongly misaligned spin axes).  If the merger occurred in an environment with multiple black holes in a big disk - say circulating a supermassive black hole - that could account for all observations.</p>

<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6335998#.YjFKrC8r2eQ">Research Software Capability in Australia</a> - Michelle Barker and Markus Buchhorn</p>

<p>Interesting results from a late-2021 ARDC survey on research software capability,
of 70 managers of Australian research computing and data groups.  Results
were scaled to try to give an estimate of all-of-Australia numbers.</p>

<p>The article by Savill gives an overview, and the full report by Barker and
Buchhorn is interesting reading.   Some key findings taken from the article
and the report:</p>

<ul>
  <li>About 6,000 people (and about 2,500 FTEs) working in roles that provide software development.</li>
  <li>That’s about 1 FTE worth of software developer (broadly defined) effort per 40 researchers.</li>
  <li>46% of respondents perceived that the skills of their research software capability they manage were adequate.</li>
  <li>78% of respondents answered “yes” or “maybe” to a question on whether these personnel had access to mechanisms to improve their skills.  (LJD: That’s not super encouraging.  Free Coursera courses is <em>a</em> mechanism to improve skills…)</li>
  <li>80 different job titles were listed as used for these staff.  (LJD: 80!!!!)</li>
  <li>Only 33% of these staff have permanent employment.</li>
  <li>56% of researchers did not feel there was adequate research software capability in their area - rising to 60% of those with a focus on an entire discipline and 75% for those with a whole-of-University focus.  (LJD: These numbers are consistent with sub-disciplines that are heavy software users and probably contributors disproportionately returning surveys, which I think is what I’d expect.)</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers - and the problems they suggest - seem plausible to me for
Canada, as well.  The reliance on unfunded and part-time software development
and maintenance is a real issue, as is the lack of any kind of coherent career
track (80 job titles!!).  The good news is that 43% of respondents had plans
to recruit more people into those roles over the next 1-3 years.</p>

<p>Do these proportions seem about right in your neck of the woods (be that
geography or discipline?). Do things look like they’re getting better or
worse?</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/agileinsider/building-a-backlog-your-team-will-love-ba159c1b6ad7">Building a Backlog Your Team Will Love</a> - Blurbs By Amy</p>

<p>At my last job — and this was my fault — the backlog became an undifferentiated
mass.  We did keep higher priorities to the top, and lower priority items to
the bottom.  There was a <em>lot</em> there, though, some we were clearly never going
to get to, and the tickets were of very different size… yeah, it wasn’t great.</p>

<p>Here Amy outlines her teams workflow, and it looks pretty good:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An inbox, called “Add New Here” to make it completely unambiguous that new tasks go there.</li>
  <li>Have “Not planning to do” and “Future Nice to Haves” sections for record-keeping but to keep these from clogging up the works.</li>
  <li>The workflow is that inbox items get groomed and then immediately triaged (duaged?) into “Groomed + Prioritized” for high-priority tasks, and “Groomed + Not Prioritized” for the lower-priority tasks, or one of the parking lots.</li>
  <li>Then  tasks get selected into Next Sprint tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the unambiguous process here.  You’re clearly doing something wrong
if you add a ticket anywhere than “add new here”, for instance.  Having two
different parking lot sections seems a bit much, but it lets you move tasks
into “Future nice to haves” without feeling like you’re consigning it to the
dustbin.  Over time clean-up can move things into Not Planning to Do, and
adjust the priorities of groomed tasks.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the Python core team for deprecating and then removing
some old stdlib modules.  Choosing to stop supporting something is genuinely
hard, and at Python scales even clearly past-its-best-before-date modules
like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/cgi.html">cgi</a> (cgi!!!) are probably
used by thousands of people.   Getting rid of a stdlib (and thus <em>de facto</em>
default) cryptography module which is woefully inadequate for today’s world
will avoid many more headaches than getting rid of

<p>This one’s a couple years old, and I’m surprised I hadn’t seen it before.</p>

<p>It’s getting easy to find good examples for scientists of getting started
with GitHub, and then to CI/CD, for code.  But for data it’s much harder.
And there’s no reason why experimental data shouldn’t benefit from versioning,
and analysis pipeline CI/CD that code does.  As data gets cleaned up and the
pipeline matures, and data products start being released, these tools are
just as useful.</p>

<p>Here the authors publish a recipe, instructions, and template repos for <a href="https://github.com/weecology/livedat">Github Actions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/weecology/livedat">Travis CI</a> with data.  The immediate audience is for ecology, but the process is pretty general.  The instructions cover configuring the repo, connecting to Zenodo (for data artifacts) and the CI/CD tool.  Then data checks can be added (with the pipeline failing if the data breaks a validity constraint).  And data analysis can be done, with data products being published and versioned when a new release is created.  It’s really cool!</p>

<p>By making the things we want to see (data checking, proper data releases)
easier, as with automating them, we get more of what we want to see in the
world.  This is very useful work.</p>

Here Renou &amp; Tuloup describes the latest version that has a REPL application that ships with default, so that the NumPy website lets you play with NumPy code interactively.</p>

<p>The authors walk you through several ways of “deploying” JupyterLite in static webpages, as a standalone static page in GitHub Pages or Vercel or Netlify, or including it in sphinx output for documentation, either as the repl or the entire notebook UI.</p>

<p>This is going to make teaching training sessions and giving demonstrations much easier, and make documentation much more interesting!</p>

<p>In a lot of fields, file formats have grown in perceived importance well
beyond any reasonable measure.  (Hi, bioinformatics!)  People spend a lot of
time arguing how bytes should be arrayed on disk, rather than focussing what
APIs the data libraries should support, pinning down the API, and then
supporting one or more data layouts that support the APIs efficiently.</p>

<p>In geophysical data, NetCDF was a big help and nudged the community in
productive directions. It laid out a pretty strict API for labelled gridded
data, with a couple underlying file representations.  Conventions (basically
formats) developed around how to store different kinds of data in the NetCDF
APIs, and that was that.  File formats changed over time (including pretty
drastically with NetCDF4), and it was all cool because there were tools to
convert.</p>

<p>Parquet is becoming that <em>lingua franca</em> for columns of data, which is what
you frequently want for reading data into memory or streaming through it to
get relevant pieces.  GeoParquet is a library (and proposed de facto standard)
for storing GIS-type data in Parquet.  One of the lovely things about Parquet
is that it ties nicely into Arrow for computing on or interchanging the at a
in memory.</p>

<p>In the article, Holmes lays out the advantages of Parquet format to some other
attempts.  He refers to Parquet (and some alternatives) as cloud-native, but
efficient columnar data formats work just as well streaming through data
on-prem, even on block storage.  Parquet is built to support cloud-native
things like streaming data, but that’s not necessary for this to be a useful
format.  The repository at the second link has v0.1 of the specification.</p>

<p><a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/scalable-checkpoint-restart-for-mpi">SCR: Scalable Checkpoint/Restart for MPI</a> - LLNL</p>

<p>Coming back to HPC, I’ll probably be “discovering” things that have been going on for a while when I wasn’t paying attention - apologies in advance.  This is the first I’ve heard of LLNL’s <a href="https://github.com/LLNL/scr">open source</a> scalable checkpoint/restart library, which already had it’s v3.0 come out recently.  It makes use of the increasingly hierarchical nature of storage, flushing checkpoints out to local storage, and then only periodically pushing one of the checkpoints out to global persistent storage.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cr8escape-new-vulnerability-discovered-in-cri-o-container-engine-cve-2022-0811/">cr8escape: New Vulnerability in CRI-O Container Engine Discovered by CrowdStrike (CVE-2022-0811)</a> -  John Walker &amp; Manoj Ahuje, CloudStrike</p>

<p>Good overview by Walker &amp; Ahuje of a vulnerability in the CRI-O container
runtime, used by default in many new kubernetes installs, which lets users
who can create pod definitions initiate pods which can be escaped from due
to addition of support for (and insufficient validation of arguments to)
sysctl.</p>

<p>Philosophically, I’m actually pleased to see that published exploits for
escaping container runtimes are becoming increasingly either complicated or
reliant on processes around operation; things are getting very mature.  On a
more practical nature, if you’re running CRI-O 1.19 and up, upgrade to patched
versions, downgrade to 1.18, an/or add k8s policies to block pods that contain
sysctl settings containing “+” or “=”.</p>

<p>In most of research computing, gitops isn’t advanced much past software deveclopment CI/CD pipelines (which are already great!). But we can do a lot more tying version control changes to configuration files to deployment.  Here the StackHPC team walks through using GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI/CD) to automating open stack database changes using <a href="https://github.com/stackhpc/kayobe-automation">their tool for Kayobe automation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shape-of-code.com/2022/03/13/growth-in-flops-used-to-train-ml-models/">Growth in FLOPs used to train ML models</a> - Derek Jones<br />
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924">Compute Trends Across Three Eras of Machine Learning</a> - Jaime Sevilla, Lennart Heim, Anson Ho, Tamay Besiroglu, Marius Hobbhahn, Pablo Villalobos, arXiv:2202.05924</p>

<p>Jones has a nice summary of a paper by Sevilla <em>et al</em>., who went through the literature finding 493 ML models, and recording estimated flops for 129 of them, and very helpfully <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AAIebjNsnJj_uKALHbXNfn3_YsT6sHXtCU0q7OIPuc4/edit">made their data available</a>.  Sevilla <em>et al.</em> looks at the data through the lens of pre-deep learning, the start of deep learning, and large-scale deep learning.  Jones looks at it from the kinds of compute systems used: generic university clusters or other DIY systems, cloud computing, and more recently some special-purpose deep learning systems.   It’s an interesting and fairly clear trifurcation:</p>

<p><img alt="Plot of FLOPs spent training models from pre-1990 to roughly today, in two very clear eras: DIY general purpose systems pre 2008, and then cloud computing and increasingly custom-built-deep-learning systems afterwards.  The onset of deep learning methods and use of cloud are roughly coincident, and the slope of FLOPs used over time goes up sharply post-2008." src="https://buttondown.s3.amazonaws.com/images/e25970a1-ae40-41ef-8124-328bae3feebd.png" /></p>

<p>Jones concludes with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Supercomputer users have been facing the possibility of hitting the wall of maximum compute for over a decade. ML training is still a minnow in the supercomputer world, where calculations run for months, rather than a few days.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This overstates things in my opinion - recent peak usage of 1e24 FLOPs used to train a model is four months on a 100PF system assuming 100% efficiency - that’s a hero calculation by any measure.  And usage is trending up <em>very</em> fast.</p>

<h3 id="about-this-newsletter">About This Newsletter</h3>

<p>Research computing - the intertwined streams of software development, systems, data management and analysis - is much more than technology.  It’s teams, it’s communities, it’s product management - it’s people.  It’s also one of the most important ways we can be supporting science, scholarship, and R&amp;D today.</p>

<p>So research computing teams are too important to research to be managed poorly.  But no one teaches us how to be effective managers and leaders in academia.  We have an advantage, though - working in research collaborations have taught us the advanced management skills, but not the basics.</p>

<p>This newsletter focusses on providing new and experienced research computing and data managers the tools they need to be good managers without the stress, and to help their teams achieve great results and grow their careers.</p>
