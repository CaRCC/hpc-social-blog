Now that we can, should we meet in person?; Writing better job ads; Taking time off; the UK's CLIMB-COVID; how Herbie happened; digital humanities project charters; bioinformatics webasm

              <p>Hi there:</p>

<p>We’re going into a long weekend here in Toronto - the second-to-last one of the summer - and it’s very much needed.  We have a number of pretty ambitious efforts we’re working on, and it’s been a long year already.  I hope that you and your team are taking care of yourself, and that you in particular as manager or team lead are taking some time off.  There’s an article below on the importance - both for you and your team - of you taking some time off, to recharge yourself and give your team the opportunity to step up.</p>

<p>Also, there was some interest in the AWS ARM HPC hackathon that was in the roundup last week. I know that a number of readers are, like me, in the genomics space right now.  Let me know if you think you or your team might be interested in participating in a similar week-long hackathon for ARM specifically around genomics; as always, just hit “reply” if you get this in your email, or email jonathan@researchcomputingteams.org if you want to talk about that or about anything that comes up in the newsletter.</p>

<p>And on to the roundup:</p>

<h2 id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/07/when-do-we-actually-need-to-meet-in-person">When Do We Actually Need to Meet in Person?</a> - Rae Ringel</p>

<p>In the past 17 months, having to work and communicate in new ways,  we’ve learned to be thoughtful in planning how to communicate and work together.  With teams starting to be able to meet in person, there’s no need to discard that thoughtfulness!  What the right approach for a meeting will be will depend on the the goals and purpose of the meeting.</p>

<p>Here Ringel offers a simple framework for thinking about when a meeting benefits from being in-person.  Complex goals and building/maintaining relationships push towards favouring in-person meetings, while simple goals and working on tasks favour hybrid or asynchronous meetings.  (Incidentally, those are also the meetings where very strong meeting facilitation skills are the most necessary).</p>

<p><img alt="Do we need to meet in person?  This image lays some example reasons for a meeting on a spectrum, with conflict resolution being complex and relationship driven at the in-person side, while updates and briefings are at the hybrid- or asychronous-side." src="https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2021/07/W20210707_RINGEL_GOALS.png" /></p>

<p>Relatedly, a lot of managers are starting to think of ice-breaker/team-building activities to get people used to working together in person again, particularly when new members have joined the team while it was purely distributed.   Lots of people are suggesting games like <a href="https://www.peoplestorming.com/post/zip-zap-boing">Zip Zap Boing</a> - what sorts of things have people tried?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tiernok.com/posts/2021/writing-better-job-ads/">Writing Better Job Ads</a> - Eli Weinstock-Herman</p>

<p>This is a nice lengthy post on writing job ads.  And given what I see scanning job ads for research computing team managers, the advice is needed!</p>

<p>There’s too much for me to completely summarize, but some key points</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Job Ad is a Landing Page… A job ad is marketing.  An <strong>advertisement</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t agree with this enough.  Even if what you have to post on your institutional jobs website is constrained to have to have all kinds of meaningless boilerplate and a dry list of job requirements - and at universities and hospitals there’s definitely some of that - there’s little to nothing stoping you from posting a job ad elsewhere, on your team’s website or on external job boards.  You can direct people to the dry-as-dust “official” posting to apply.</p>

<p>What’s worse, most of the stuff we’re tend to put into job descriptions and job ads are… well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…]  I’m more and more looking at “5+ years of (skill)” as an intellectually lazy statement. […]
<strong>I wrote a job ad for a fungible human gear.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>God yes.  Even if “5 years of C++” (or whatever) was a meaningful measure, like any given 12-month period of experience working with C++ was interchangeable, it’s an <em>input</em>.  A person with that laundry list of inputs <em>might</em>, if you’ve done your job well, be able to be a capable team member, but what you care about are the <em>outputs</em> - the results the new team member helps the team achieve.  And other combinations of inputs might help the new team member accomplish those things just as well or better.</p>

<p>Weinstock-Herman makes the following suggestions for a process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with the end in mind (always a good focus)</li>
  <li>Create the core of the job ad first:
    <ul>
      <li>What will the candidate achieve?</li>
      <li>What are expectations from a team member in this role?</li>
      <li>What are the specific tools/processes in use</li>
      <li>What does the team do, why is it interesting, what’s the impact?</li>
      <li>What does compensation, benefits look like?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Boil it down to a pitch</li>
  <li>Work on tone, length, engagement</li>
  <li>Test, test, test</li>
  <li>Post thoughtfully</li>
</ul>

<p>We have <em>huge</em> advantages in research for hiring.  We’re helping <em>advance the frontier of human knowledge</em>.  We’re doing meaningful work, not trying to drive up click rates on advertisements.  We offer the possibility of going between multiple quite different projects, learning both new tech and new science along the way, and the possibility of outsized impact.  Why do so many of our job ads read like working in our field is a chore, that could easily be done by anyone with 3 years experience in linux and 4 years in “a scripting language”?</p>

<a href="https://jacobian.org/2019/apr/23/questions-for-employers-director-vp/">My questions for prospective employers (Director/VP roles)</a> - Jacob Kaplan-Moss</p>

<p>We do a lot of discussion of hiring from the hiring manager side of the table in the newsletter, but when thinking of our own career prospects it’s worth considering what we should ask when we’re the candidate, too.</p>

<p>Asking questions about how the position came to be free, the goals of the organization, the goals of the position, what six-month success looks like, how much autonomy the role has, travel requirements - these are all important things to know before you take a job offer.</p>

<p><a href="https://fellow.app/blog/management/out-of-office-managers-need-vacations-too/?utm_campaign=TLDR&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=143756685&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--BkRRrm8ZzTLBJuTcGpvxtluUC1Emn-uAVhtkKKTLE7kEzTwF-u-VrhE6AToHc7BXXGSFI5ESBDa3QxYSsegkJw2iRmslWbTsnY7BY7NJSNxnCjvY&amp;utm_content=143756685&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Out of Office Alert: Managers Need Vacations Too!</a> - Samantha Rae Ayoub, Fellow</p>

<p>It’s important to take time off to recharge, even though as managers we’re often not great at this.  It’s a little too easy to convince ourselves that our firm hand on the till is too important to completely let go… and that’s a self-fulfilling prophesy.  You’re robbing yourself of needed R&amp;R, and your team members of the chance to step up in your absence, by not completely checking out.  And the more often you completely step away, the easier it gets for you and the team</p>

<p>Ayoub goes through ten steps to go through - the key ones to my mind are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Prep a “While I’m Away” list</li>
  <li>Put one person in charge</li>
  <li>Ask your team to keep a collaborative set of notes</li>
  <li>Turn on your Out of Office Alert</li>
  <li>Do not reply to your email or voicemails</li>
  <li>Carve out 2 hours in the morning when you get back to get caught up</li>
</ul>

<p>One really clever suggestion I don’t know that I’ve read before is, in to make that “while I’m away” document a shared writable document and have it not only be a checklist of things to do but somewhere where people keep notes of what was done, what happened at the meeting with Prof X, etc - so you come back to a briefing document to catch you up.</p>

<p>The other really crucial thing is to put one person in charge while you’re away - or at the very least to have a very clear decision making process.  Decisions will have to be made in your absence, and the team needs to know how to make them.  You can rotate between people, but it should be someone who has a pretty good big-picture view of the work of the team.</p>

<a href="https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/07/29/how-uk-scientists-developed-transformative-hpc-powered-coronavirus-sequencing-system/">How UK Scientists Developed Transformative, HPC-Powered Coronavirus Sequencing System</a> - HPC Wire</p>

<p>The UK has lead the world in sequencing and surveilling the evolution of SaRS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; and roughly a quarter of the world’s SaRS-CoV-2 genomics data has passed through the COVID-19 Genomics UK’s (COG-UK) CLIMB-COVID infrastructure, which is described in this paper and HPC Wire article.</p>

<p>While COG-UK’s sequencing efforts are distributed, the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) takes a hub model for integrating the genomic and epidemiological data.</p>

<p>The heart of CLIMB-COVID is <a href="https://github.com/SamStudio8/majora/">Majora</a>, a Django-based application with both a web and <a href="https://github.com/SamStudio8/ocarina">command-line</a> based UIs, but they had to also create simple sample-naming schemes, nextflow <a href="https://github.com/SamStudio8/elan-nextflow/">pipelines</a>, and MQTT messages communicating between pipelines and Majora, as well as online phylogenetics analysis, cluster identification, and visualisation.</p>

<h2 id="research-software-development">Research Software Development</h2>

<p><a href="https://pavpanchekha.com/blog/how-herbie.html">How Herbie Happened</a> - Pavel Panchekha</p>

<p><a href="https://herbie.uwplse.org">Herbie</a> is an automatic rewriter of numerical expressions that attempts to find equivalent but more numerically accurate expressions, available for local use but also through a web interface.  I don’t think it’s as well known in technical computing circles as it ought to be; I only learned of it as my own use of methods that required careful numerical analysis was winding down, even though it’s been in development since 2013 or so.</p>

<p>Panchekha’s article - an older one but one which is circulating again - gives an overview of the story of Herbie development, beginning when he was a grad student.  It originally started with a recognition that not much CS or programming language work was being done on the quite important task of improving numerical accuracy, and so even modest progress would be important.  The lessons he took from the Herbie effort are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tackle ambitious problems</li>
  <li>Know how you work best - he doesn’t work well alone</li>
  <li>Good benchmarks guide research</li>
  <li>Generating reports from search processes is great for debugging</li>
  <li>You never know what will be important</li>
  <li>Some small things matter a lot</li>
  <li>Don’t submit papers too early</li>
  <li>If you keep rewriting something, think deeper</li>
  <li>Make a demo</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the the great things about this article is the bracing honesty with which he writes about false starts and dead ends.  Also, the online demo, which was originally meant more just to have something interesting on the project’s web page, was very important both for communicating what Herbie does and getting feedback from users.  All in all this is a nice behind-the-scenes writeup of a research computing project.</p>

<h2 id="research-data-management-and-analysis">Research Data Management and Analysis</h2>

<p><a href="https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/life-on-the-diagonal-adventures-in-2d-time/">Life on the diagonal — adventures in 2-D time</a> -  Luke Plant</p>

<p>It’s pretty common in research computing to not just manage data but the history of the data - how it’s changed over time.  There are solutions like temporal tables in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011">SQL:2011</a> (or other approaches, lumped together under the term of art “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension">slowly changing dimension</a>”) to be able to view what the data values looked like at some earlier time/version.  In addition, there’s now a number of newer “git, for data” solutions which make it easy for people to collaboratively update the data while maintaining history.  It’s all very cool stuff, and if those tools match any of your use cases, you should absolutely use them, it’s not something you have to implement yourself any more.</p>

<p>But when the data that’s being updated at different times <em>is itself a timeline</em>, all of this can get kind of hard to think about.   Plant walks us through a mental model for thinking of this, two dimensional time - the event time (when something actually happened) and the knowledge time (when it was recorded in the database), and makes an analogy that we experience life on the diagonal of this 2-d time; when something happens and when we learn of them are roughly equivalent in importance.</p>

<p>The fundamental reason that this is hard to think about is that “time” means two things, which is why the introduction of“event time” vs “knowledge time” as terms is very valuable.  Incidentally, I’ve had two hours of meetings this month trying to come to a technical solution for a data modelling problem, only for us to realize as we were hanging up on the second meeting that we were using “dataset” to mean two slightly different things and that was causing the problem.  Naming things is important!</p>

<p>While the biggest story of databases over the past 15 years has been the divergence and specialization into a diverse range of capabilities, the second biggest story has been partial convergence - NoSQL developing partial ACID capabilities and stalwart databases like PostgreSQL and MariaDB developing capability for sophisticated JSON handling and text indexing.</p>

<p>If your use case is principally full-text search you’d be better off with Elasticsearch or moral equivalent, of course, or if all you needed were JSON objects you’d go with MongoDB, but increasingly if you need <em>some</em> full text capability or <em>some</em> unstructured JSON support  in something that’s already using a relational database, there’s less and less reason to introduce another data store.  In this article, Batuigas walks us through what full-text indexing can and can’t do in Postgres.</p>

<p>I know I’ve been on a bit of a Web Assembly kick here lately and that many seem odd to readers coming from (say) HPC.  But here’s a lovely example of a package of real bioinformatics tools and libraries (biowasm) distributed as Web Assembly packages ready to be run interactively in the browser - and with Web Workers, being able to load files from the local file system.  And Genome Ribbon is an early example of the kind of complex applications that can be built this way - visualization of complex genomic rearrangements in the browser, without any of the data ever leaving your computer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc21/presentation/ousterhout">A Linux Kernel Implementation of the Homa Transport Protocol</a> - John Ousterhout, USENIX ATC ’21</p>

<p>TCP/IP is an amazing technological achievement and makes the internet possible.  Wide area networks were how the internet began, but individual data centres with tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes very much were not, and TCP isn’t great within a datacenter or large cluster.  Google’s described their user-space TCP replacement between services, <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/11/11/snap-networking/">Snap</a>, which they’ve been using since 2016.</p>

<p>In this paper and slide deck, Ousterhout describes their linux kernel implementation of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09615">Homa protocol</a>, which the developers feel addresses the many failings of TCP within a datacenter:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connection oriented - high space and time overheads</li>
  <li>Stream oriented - but most within-datacentre communications is more like remote procedure calls, and stream oriented approaches cause <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking">head-of-line blocking</a></li>
  <li>Fair sharing of bandwidth increases latency for short messages</li>
  <li>Sender-driven congestion control requires buffers to detect congestion</li>
  <li>In-order packet delivery makes load balancing very difficult</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s interesting to compare this approach with that of AWS’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/in-the-search-for-performance-theres-more-than-one-way-to-build-a-network/">Scalable Reliable Datagram</a>, which we covered in <a href="https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/91ac8150-7348-47fe-86bf-390d70f17c4b">#80</a>, particularly the concern with congestion and tail latency.   For all workloads tested, all message sizes, and for a variety of other network traffic happening, Homa had one-to-two orders of magnitude advantage for P99 latency, and 2.7-7.5x improvements in median latency.   Homa focuses very much on latency, with receiver-driven congestion control and prioritizes messages based on the shortest remaining processing time first.</p>
