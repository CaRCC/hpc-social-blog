title: '#30 - Link Roundup, 26 June 2020'
---

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>As we get ready to move our team from one institution to another, we’re taking the opportunity to reconsider how we do things on our team and reset expectations about how we operate and what we’re aiming to achieve - as a team, and as a project.  The switch to working from home was an earlier opportunity to clarify and reset, too.</p>

<p>In Canada, <a href="https://betakit.com/report-77-percent-of-canadian-it-leaders-say-employees-wont-return-to-office-as-normal-after-covid-19/">77% of IT organizations</a> say that expectations around everyone going to the office everyday have been changed probably irreversably by the pandemic.  With universities, hospitals, and research institutes constantly tight on space, I have to think that a lot of our organizations are having similar conversations.  In the jobs section, there’s a first for the newsletter - a manager position listed a remote position.  At your org, are people discussing having work from home being a serious option in the future?  Is anyone considering operating as a fully- or mostly-distributed team indefinitely?</p>

<p>On to the link roundup:</p>

<h2 id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>

<p><a href="https://knowyourteam.com/blog/2020/06/21/new-manager-training-the-4-concepts-to-teach/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=kytnewsletter">New Manager Training: The 4 concepts to Teach</a> - Claire Lew, Know Your Team<br />
<a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">Being Glue</a> - Tanya Reilly</p>

<p>If you’re at the point where you’re starting to manage (or groom) team leads or managers, Clair Lew’s article and collection of resources on four things to teach new managers is useful.  Her four concepts to teach (which she covers in details with resources to use to to teach them are):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The mindset shift: IC → Manager.  (This is so important; <em>no</em> promotion or job change is as tough a transition as your that move from IC to manager - and I say that after switching fields from astrophysics to genomics!)</li>
  <li>The importance of trust </li>
  <li>1-on-1 meetings are your most high-leverage tool as a manager</li>
  <li>Answer the questions, ”What’s going on?” and ”Where are we going?” for your team</li>
</ul>

<p>Tanya Reilly’s talk focuses an aspect the first one - that as a manager, an increasing amount of your time is spent doing”glue work” rather than the technical work of the team.  And while that glue work is necessary for everything to come together (and stay together), it isn’t as valued as the technical work.  So much so that ICs stepping up and doing that glue work aren’t seen as overreaching or as promotion material, but more often as being less capable than the ICs focussed on the nuts and bolts of their tasks.</p>

<p><a href="https://firstround.com/review/the-managers-guide-to-inclusive-leadership-small-habits-that-make-a-big-impact/">The Manager’s Guide to Inclusive Leadership — Small Habits That Make a Big Impact</a> - First Round Review</p>

<p>This is a really nice article that’s well worth your time about more inclusive leadership.  They give some four high-level topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Invite and display authenticity</li>
  <li>Build self-awareness and curiosity</li>
  <li>Seek out and respond well to feedback</li>
  <li>Lift up other perspectives consistently</li>
</ul>

<p>But then go relatively deeply into each of them and give specific questions you can ask and approaches you can take.  The contributors are trainers at <a href="https://lifelabslearning.com/">LifeLabs Learning</a>, which leads training and facilitation around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and the article links to a much longer 25-page open-sourced <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aVZbj9jMbo9-JoH9_xHtpXYwmSZh-uhPXpNNzKVQRY/preview?pru=AAABcuJt9nQ*O-_v_0TMbdOh-6mfd_lBcg">playbook</a> for starting up a DEI team which also looks promising.</p>

<p>We’ve talked about the importance of disagreement and input before, and how important it is that people feel ok speaking up.  This is another article on the topic, and it breaks the steps down into managing what people are saying but also managing the silence, what people <em>aren’t</em> saying, which I think is a useful way to think about things.</p>

<p><a href="https://applied.economist.com/articles/managingup">How to “manage up” from home</a>- The Economist</p>

<p>Since many of us have been working from home for the past three months, it’s been harder managing our team, but maybe even harder being visible to our bosses (and other senior stakeholders) and maintaining those connections.</p>

<p>As with our teams, there’s no magic here - we just need to do what we should always be doing, communicating, listening, and documenting.  And as with our team, while we could get away with being less explicit and intentional about some of these steps when we were all in an office together, distance means we need to put more discipline into these sorts of actions.</p>

<p>The pandemic has shifted expectations about how we deliver training and education; that shift might be long-lasting.</p>

<p>Now that many of us have gotten past the emergency, ”let’s just make this work” phase, it may be useful to have team members start a more comprehensive training program.   <a href="https://ctlt.ubc.ca/programs/all-our-programs/online-teaching-program/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Edubytes_June_2020">The Online Teaching Program</a> of University of British Columbia’s Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology has made their Online Teaching Program modules for faculty available more widely.   There’s a lot of good material there, and the material itself is a good model for teaching online.</p>

<p>A draft of Denis Bakhvalov’s book, ”Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU” is available for review, and will be available for free by PDF when it is final.</p>

<p>This is a very low-level book on performance on modern CPUs, discussing speculative execution, branch misprediction, instruction-level parallelism issues, and the like.  I look forward to seeing this out in its final form.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-infrastructure-2020-6-european-research-infrastructures-not-financially-sustainable/">European research infrastructures</a><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-infrastructure-2020-6-european-research-infrastructures-not-financially-sustainable/"> </a><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-infrastructure-2020-6-european-research-infrastructures-not-financially-sustainable/">‘not</a><a href="https://www.researchprofessionalnews.com/rr-news-europe-infrastructure-2020-6-european-research-infrastructures-not-financially-sustainable/"> financially sustainable’ </a>- Ben Upton, Research Professional News (Paywalled)</p>

<p>An expert panel has taken a look at the current financial sustainability of European research infrastructures (whichincludes but is not limited to digital research infrastructure).  Despite a push for sustainability over the past several years, there’s still no systemic financial sustainability for these Europe-wide ”core facilities” for research</p>

<p>From the executive summary of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/strategy_on_research_and_innovation/documents/ec_rtd_transformative-impact-ris-on-euro-research.pdf">report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, issues of misalignment of national roadmap exercises and funding plans for RIs need to be overcome to make the implementation of the full RI system supporting the European Research Area (ERA) more time efficient and cost-effective.  Despite long-term sustainability being increasingly emphasised in EU funding instrument call texts, this issue remains challenging for the vast majority of RIs. We find that few RIs outside the European Intergovernmental Research Organisation forum (EIROforum) grouping are able to demonstrate the characteristics required to achieve long-term sustainability. In addition, we note that unique research infrastructures are also operated by networks and that the full deployment of competitive research services in Europe cannot be pursued by implementing an ever-growing number of autonomous legal RI entities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report calls for member governments to step up and align funding, for better ”life cycle management” and maturity assessments of the research infrastructures, more integration activities, and better coordination across funding pillars.</p>

<p>The report is very comprehensve, and has overviews of ~40 such EU-wide infrastructures; it’s interesting reading if this is your jam.  (It is mine)</p>

<p><a href="https://materialize.io/rust-for-data-intensive-computation/">Rust for Data-Intensive Computation</a> - Frank McSherry</p>

<p>Frank McSherry, of differential privacy and timely dataflow fame, has a blog post out on his company’s site on the use of Rust for data-intensive computation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifically, I’ve found several of Rust’s key idioms line up very well with the performance and correctness needs of data-intensive computing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He describes the benefits of Rust’s approach to generics (traits), and use of higher-level programming with closures, for work in this space.  Maybe more controversially, he suggests Rust’s focus on ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes is a relatively low bar as well as helpful for data-intensive work:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fortunately, they are crucial concepts in data-intensive computation, and putting them right in your face both makes you think about them, and makes your users accept that they are a thing worth thinking about too.</p>
</blockquote>
