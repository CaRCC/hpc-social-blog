Planning a return to offices; Common misses in developing team members; PRs: yea or nay?; National lab vs academia; Collecting data from the internet of (old) things

              <p>Hi, everyone:</p>

<p>I hope you’ve been well; I’ve had a short week with a 4-day Easter long weekend.  Between being recharged for the weekend, and finally having a couple of days of work where I could focus on high-leverage activities - hiring discussions for our team and pushing forward a hiring process at an organizational level; writing a document useful in itself but also that will be a model for team members to write others in the future; getting two teams aligned and getting them to find a really good solution to a shared design problem - it’s been a really good week.</p>

<p>It took me a long time to re-orient myself to understanding what “a good day’s work” looks like for a manager.  Everything is so much more direct and quicker-feedback as an individual contributor; the thing works or it doesn’t.   As a manager, quick wins are few and far between - and you can only be really sure you made the right decision months after making it.   So having two or three good managerial days in a row is a nice feeling and a good way to wind down a week.</p>

<p>I hope you’re having similar success.</p>

<p>And now, on to the roundup.</p>

<h2 id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>

<p><a href="https://makeworkbetter.substack.com/p/10-stage-guide-to-planning-your-return">10 Stage Guide to Planning Your Return</a> -  Bruce Daisley, Make Work Better</p>

<p>At some point, the pandemic will be over and we’ll all be deciding what to do about the workplace.  I think the most successful research computing teams will remain mostly distributed - and will in fact become more distributed as they start to hire new far-flung team members.  But it’s not entirely up to all of us, and even those who stay largely WFH will probably want to come into the office together occasionally.</p>

<p>Daisley goes through ten steps in figuring out what “return” should look like.  He lays out five nice clear things that “the office” did for us before:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It was a place to meet people by appointment</li>
  <li>It was a place to meet people by accident</li>
  <li>It was a workshop to do our best work</li>
  <li>It was a place of congregation - we could foster team cohesion there</li>
  <li>It was a place of learning</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these we now have pretty clear ways of dealing with without an office, but I think there’s areas where we’re still trying to figure things out.  We have figured out 1 outside the office, and mostly 3 (although in-person white boarding is really powerful).  Some teams are doing pretty well with 4, some aren’t.  2 and 5 I think most of us are still struggling with - especially teaching junior hires.</p>

<p>With those laid out, Daisley advocates for an experimental approach - find out what people’s needs are, propose experiments (with clear measures of success), and try them.</p>

<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/04/research-how-to-get-better-at-killing-bad-projects">Research: How to Get Better at Killing Bad Projects</a> - Ronald Klingebiel, HBR</p>

<p>As we talked about at the start of the year, it’s hard to stop doing things, even when they don’t make sense any more.  As Klingebiel reports, even big companies with well-established stage gate processes for advancing projects are tempted to fudge the requirements to let struggling projects advance and take up more resources - especially when the requirements that are struggling are (the more important!) external user requirements which are about the future and nebulous users, as opposed to the very salient internal struggles like technical difficulty.</p>

<p>To avoid the problems seen by Sony Ericsson in this study, Klingebiel recommends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t look for “proof” of failure - there’ll never be such proof</li>
  <li>Look instead for projects that are demonstrating promise and move resources into them</li>
  <li>Focus on external user needs (in their lingo, the business case)</li>
</ul>

<p>Fournier writes about some common ways that managers - especially new managers but I’d argue it’s quite common even in more experienced managers - fail to develop the skills of their team members.  While we’ll often make time for a team member to learn some new framework or to read some papers in a new area, building them up in their technical/product leadership ability is more rare.   Not only is this a wasted growth opportunity for the team members, it’s an good and important way for you to make time to grow your own skills in delegation - and then to be able to take on other responsibilities!</p>

<p>Fournier calls out five areas she sees that technical managers <em>don’t</em> take the opportunity to grow their ICs, and describes each very well in the article:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing all the technical design work yourself</li>
  <li>Doing all of the project management yourself</li>
  <li>Neglecting to give feedback</li>
  <li>Hoarding information [LJD - this is surprisingly easy to find yourself doing unintentionally!]</li>
  <li>Focusing too much on your personal output, and</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these are very relevant in our field, but  I think this quote below on feedback is <em>especially</em> true in research:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many new managers are comfortable giving technical feedback and uncomfortable giving other kinds of feedback. They freely criticize the design and technical work of their team, but they don’t challenge their team members on other growth areas like collaboration, communication style, or project ownership.</p>

<p><a href="https://ardc.edu.au/news/launching-ml4au-a-machine-learning-community-of-practice-for-australia/">Launching ML4AU – a machine learning community of practice for Australia</a> - Australia Research Data Commons</p>

<p>An interesting effort out of Australia - <a href="https://www.ml4au.community/">ML4AU</a> is an attempt to bootstrap a national academic ML community of practice.   The effort includes ARDC, Monash, University of Queensland, NCI Australia and Pawsey,   They have a series of <a href="https://www.ml4au.community/events">events</a> (but, unhelpfully, not all are public - Monash seems to want to keep many of the events to themselves), some train-the-trainer materials and resources.  I hope this succeeds and there’s good stuff here but this seems to be well short of the critical mass necessary to start a distributed national community of practice.</p>

<p><a href="https://jessitron.com/2021/03/27/those-pesky-pull-request-reviews/">Those pesky pull request reviews</a> - Jessica Joy Kerr<br />
<a href="https://jhall.io/archive/2021/04/05/can-pair-programming-replace-code-review/">Can pair programming replace code review?</a> - Jonathan Hall</p>

<p>Kerr’s blog post in late March kicked off a series of posts in the software-dev blogosphere on whether we should still be doing pull reviews.  There’s too many posts to list here, but these two by RCT roundup regulars, cover much of the range of views.</p>

<p>Kerr’s pretty firmly on team get-rid-of-’em.  My summary of her argument: There’s a reason why no one likes getting or giving pull request reviews.  They are hard to do (because you have to load all the context of the person making the change into your head, then review the code, then come up with the review), can be unpleasant to get.  They’re inspired by the open-source github pull request model, taking untrusted code from strangers on the internet, where it works well and is necessary, but is that <em>really</em> a helpful model for a software development team?  Let’s get rid of PRs and do pair programming instead - it provides the same key functionality (knowledge dissemination to another team member and second person’s overview of the code) without the low-trust structure.  Quoting her pull-quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pull requests are an improvement on working alone. But not on working together.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hall is on team keep-’em; while he likes pair review for mentoring and for encouraging deep understanding of the code by another team member, the higher-quality of code review (by someone coming to it in the cold light of day) and the higher-quality of written documentation in the PR (meaning everyone, not just the pair involved, can see the reasoning behind the change).</p>

<p>One thing I’ve really enjoyed about this conversation has been a lot of thoughtful discussion (including by these two authors) about the why’s of code review.  Myself, I’ve been pretty influenced by Chelsea Troy’s articles about <a href="https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/18/reviewing-pull-requests/">PRs as asynchronous pair programming</a>, and if we’re going to increasingly have distributed flexible teams - even more so if we’re going to have community research software accepting external contributions - I think we’re going to have to have PRs.  That doesn’t rule out synchronous pair programming, though; I think it compliments it.</p>

<p><a href="https://vsoch.github.io/2021/national-lab-vs-academia/">Working in a National Lab vs. Academia</a> - Vanessa S.</p>

<p>Academia is a very.. particular kind of work environment, and institutional support for software development in research is pretty new and haphazard.  In this article, the author describes the difference of working at Stanford as an RSE and running an RSE team there, and as a Computer Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.</p>

<p>As the title already suggests, research computing is taken much more seriously in the national labs, and has been for (at least) couple of decades.  Pushing forward significant advances in computing infrastructure tools is a goal in and of itself there allowing for a longer-term focus on technological advancement rather just focusing on whatever professor so-and-so wrote a grant for last year.</p>

<p>It’s a good and comprehensive long read if you are interested in the comparison.</p>

<p>Some computing problems are truly universal - even so, it’s weird to see modern tech companies writing posts describing tools that I used to write documentation for at my research computing centre years ago.</p>

<p>In this article, Busic walks through tracking memory issues with the venerable valgrind memcheck, and then adds newer tools like BPF and perf.  To use those lower level tools, more knowledge is necessary, so he gives a crash course on Linux’s memory model, stack unwinding techniques, and tracing event sources, and then describes using perf (née perf_events) and BPF to track memory events in the system.</p>

<p>Kumbhar starts his article with a short but broad overview of current processor microarchitecture.  He then gives a detailed overview of the capabilities of <a href="https://hpc.fau.de/research/tools/likwid/">LIKWID</a>, a new-to-me set of tools developed over several years at Erlangen Regional Computing Center.  It looks to be a swiss-army-knife set of tools that allows understanding the topology of a node (threads, cores, sockets, caches), thread affinity domains, and pinning; for performing microbenchmarks on memory, flops, and cache; studying numa effects; setting cpu frequencies; measuring power consumption; and monitoring performance counters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] when a female passenger checked in for the flight and used or was given the title ‘Miss’, the system checked her in as a child. The system allocated them a child’s standard weight of 35 kg as opposed to the correct female standard weight of 69 kg. Consequently, with 38 females checked in incorrectly and misidentified as children, the G-TAWG takeoff mass from the load sheet was 1,244 kg below the actual mass of the aircraft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to see incident reports and postmortems done right, then aviation - which has been doing this for a long time - is always a good choice.  Check this one out.  There’s a clear technological “root cause” - the software was programmed in a jurisdiction which made clear distinctions between Miss (used for children) and Ms (for adults) and used in a country where it wasn’t, resulting in the takeoff mass of the plane being <em>one and a quarter tonnes</em> off.  But the report doesn’t stop at that.  Why didn’t the pilot notice there was a really weird number of children listed?  Why couldn’t ground staff update the numbers?  Why did no one know about this?  How did this not show up in testing?  What can we learn from this to avoid not just this but similar incidents in the future?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/604f423be90e077fdf88493f/Boeing_737-8K5_G-TAWG_04-21.pdf">PDF</a> is a short read and well worth it for a great example of an incident report.  And note the tone  - everyone was doing their job, it’s no one person’s fault, but something unacceptable happened and we need to make changes so this doesn’t happen again.</p>

<p>I’ve mentioned before my hopes for internet-of-things type connected devices to enable easier, timelier large-scale data collection for some research purposes.  But a lot of experiments have a lot of devices out there already that are decidedly not smart-devices; what to do with them?</p>

<p>Increasingly smart edge devices and tiny-ML frameworks like TensorFlow-lite make it possible to brute-force this by simply using pre-trained models to infer device readings directly.  Warden points out a pretty cool <a href="http://esp32.net">ES32</a>-based experiment <a href="https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device">with source code</a> for doing exactly such a thing.</p>

<p>Something that I find dishearting is seeing research computing teams trial adoption of a commercial cloud service by mechanically, faithfully reproducing every detail of their on-premises system - where tradeoffs were made that might be reasonable in that context but make no sense at all in a cloud environment.   The most mystifying such design “decision” I see being made is creating a single large Lustre (or moral equivalent) system for all possible users, just like in their machine room.   But… why?  I understand why that’s a reasonable choice for static infrastructure, but even there a large shared file system is n never-ending source of pain and anguish.  Why would someone replicate that in an environment where one can spin up and down filesystems and attach them to instances at will?</p>

<p>In one of the first posts to the new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/">AWS HPC Blog</a>, Pizarro talks about a new feature which takes that flexibility to an extreme - in AWS batch jobs, you can now automatically spin up ephemeral elastic file systems per job, allowing a job to generate output (or stage in inputs) to a fast POSIX file system, and then stage it out when done, for each job, minimizing the amount of time being spent maintaining or paying for such file systems.</p>
