Strategic planning basics; minimum viable governance; syncing up when async isn't working; death to CSVs; new Intel chips

              <p>Thanks, everyone, for your responses last week.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about strategy in other contexts lately - some of you will have noticed that I’ve been back on my nonsense on twitter, about the importance of having a focus.  The very insightful comments and suggestions you sent last week about how we can help more research computing teams were very on point, and I think combine to a feasible strategy.</p>

<p>Because within this newsletter community we’ve built together, we have a number of strengths:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An engaged readership,</li>
  <li>A wealth of expertise and experience - I’m guessing we have multiple person-centuries worth of research computing team management experience,</li>
  <li>A diverse range of expertise, spanning a large number of fields and sectors, and</li>
  <li>An interest in contributing back</li>
</ul>

<p>And the wide underserved community of reseach computing and data team managers, technical leads, and those thinking of becoming one, could really use our help.</p>

<p>For areas to focus on, readers mentioned the lack of resources available for new managers, especially those put in the hard position of managing yesterday’s peers; lack of ongoing mentorship; and near total absence of people talking about management in a way that sounds relatable to research computing professionals.</p>

<p>There was wide willingness to contribute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>via online communities,</li>
  <li>possible one-on-one mentorship or group calls,</li>
  <li>jointly putting together resources, and</li>
  <li>writing guest posts here and elsewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>And some suggestions for things we could contribute together that would be valuable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lists of curated resources</li>
  <li>Library of talks, ebooks</li>
  <li>Make it easier for others in the readership to give talks out in the community</li>
</ul>

<p>So if we have a goal of helping other research computing teams and their managers by providing material and mentorship relevant to them, with priorities around building resources that others can easily use and the tools for others to reach out to local communities, I think the next step is to start making a plan of action.</p>

<p>I’ll be speaking with some people in the coming weeks trying to put together some plans.   If this sounds like somethign that would be of interest to you, as an observer or a active participant, or can think of other ways this community could help other research computing teams,  jmail me - hit reply or email jonathan@researchcomputingteams.org - or <a href="https://calendly.com/jonathandursi/rct-15-minute-chat?month=2021-08">arrange a fifteen minute call with me</a>.  Either way, I’d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>And now, the roundup!</p>

<h2 id="managing-teams">Managing Teams</h2>

<p><a href="https://byanthonyboyd.com/4-practical-steps-for-strategic-planning-as-a-leader-a62c2b6be425">4 Practical Steps For Strategic Planning As A Leader</a> - Anthony Boyd</p>

<p>One hard things for new leaders to really come to terms with is that they typically have a lot more freedom in what their team does and how their team does it than might be comfortable.</p>

<p>Defining a strategy for how to do whatever your team is charged with doing is a big responsibility.  And it’s a lot scarier than staying focused on the day-to-day of routine work.  As a result, I see lots of teams or organizations with no discernible strategy whatsoever, muddling along with whatever tasks come their way - or, maybe worse, following through with zealous dedication on some idea that three years ago someone said seemed like a good idea.</p>

<p>So I keep an eye out for resources on defining strategies.  Lots of them are way too “big” - focused on enormous organizations.  Or they’re hyper-focused on things like SWOT Analyses or Business Model Canvases or Wardley Maps - which are all, you know, great, but they’re just devices to nudge thoughts and discussion into directions that might be fruitful.  A 2x2 matrix or canvas or map isn’t a strategy.  A concrete set of goals and priorities, informed by the context of the team and the environment in which it operates, <em>that</em>’s a strategy, that’s something that can help guide the routine day-to-day decisions you and team members make, and serve as a nudging guardrail to make sure you and your team are moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>In this article, Boyd describes a very down-to-earth process for defining and following through on a strategy, that he learned and developed during his time as a union leader.  It’s simple and pedestrian and it’s all that strategy is - routinely spending some time thinking of the big picture and its context, so that the day-to-day work is steered properly.</p>

<p>Boyd’s steps (followed by a course correction step) are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Think laterally - brainstorm with a large number of ideas before falling in love with any; “Use lateral thinking to create as many strategies as possible then sort through your options and use vertical thinking to drill down into the best option. “</li>
  <li>Set goals - without clear goals for your team, unit, or organization, you have no way of knowing if you’re doing well or not, or if any small decision is taking you closer to or further from your goals</li>
  <li>Set priorities - which is going to mean saying “no” or “not now” quite a bit</li>
  <li>Develop and implement a plan of action</li>
  <li>Make adjustments according to changing conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>This can be done by yourself or with the team, and involving your manager; or you can get feedback from your manager before striking off in a direction.</p>

<p>For brainstorming, whether by yourself or with others, the steps laid out in another article I saw this week, <a href="https://fellow.app/meeting-templates/shopify-brainstorming-session-template/">Shopify’s Brainstorming Session Template</a>, can help - in particular the iterative approach of brainstorm, assess, brainstorm …. distill.  And yet another article I saw, more for large organizations, about <a href="https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-design-an-effective-strategy-offsite-6a390b5f5fc2">running a strategy offsite for a leadership team</a>, is worth skimming if only to see that it’s the same as Boyd’s steps, but done in a group.   One line I like from that last article - “Choose clarity over certainty”.</p>

<a href="https://hypercontext.com/blog/communication/when-to-use-synchronous-communication">5 situations when synchronous communication is a must</a> - Hiba Amin, Hypercontext</p>

<p>We’re all spending a lot more time in written communication than we were before, and there are huge advantages!  But there are some common failure modes, including having interminable conversations that don’t actually result in some conclusion.   Reilly has three hints for winding up those discussions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rollup: distill a long thread into the state of the conversation - “To summarize: the problem is X. Possible paths forward are A, B, C. Sounds like we’re leaning towards A. Have I missed anything?”   This is an incredibly useful tool to have at your disposal for long-running synchronous conversations too.</li>
  <li>Maybe this is a stupid question, but…. - if the conversation isn’t going anywhere, it can be because people are talking past each other, and there’s some point which isn’t clear or isn’t understood the same way by all parties.  Being willing to ask a question that seems obvious is very useful.</li>
  <li>Move to synchronous mechanisms like a quick call - sometimes the loss of non-word signals that come across in voice or video, or just the long turn-around of async communications, is slowing things down.  At some point it may be easier to hop on a quick call.</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of that last point, Amin talks about some situations where you shouldn’t even try to communicate asynchronously if you can avoid it - they’re all areas where building relationships is the goal, or higher-bandwidth-than-just-text communications are necessary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One-on-one meetings</li>
  <li>Team building</li>
  <li>Difficult conversations</li>
  <li>Crisis communication</li>
  <li>Onboarding new employees</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/hybrid-work-schedule-planning">How to Plan Your Ideal Hybrid Work Schedule (So You Can Live Your Best Life)</a> - Regina Borsellino</p>

<p>We’ve talked a lot about the challenges of arranging hybrid work for your team members, but you’re a team member too.  What will work best for you?</p>

<p>Borsellino’s article goes into much more depth than most I’ve seen, walking you through 37 questions to help you make some decisions, under categories of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what requirements does your employer have</li>
  <li>what schedule will help your productivity the most</li>
  <li>what schedule will give you access to the professional opportunities you want and need</li>
  <li>what hybrid work schedule will give you the optimal amount of social interaction</li>
  <li>what schedule will help you live your best life, at work and home</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s too much to summarize here, but if you haven’t yet started working through your work plans and they might be hybrid, this is a good starting point.</p>

<p>Because of an immune condition, I’m going to be <em>way</em> on the late side of coming back into the office.  I like the idea of coming in 1-2 days a week, or maybe 3 days a week but just the afternoons (say) - and spending the rest of time either working from home, or some coffee shops in the neighbourhood.  With our team distributed across the country, I can meet my managerial obligations that way comfortably, and it will give me a nice blend of productivity and peace of mind.  The exact schedule, well, we’ll have to experiment a bit and see.   What are your current plans - and what would your ideal plans be?</p>

<p><a href="https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/">Minimum Viable Governance: lightweight community structure to grow your FOSS project</a> - Justin Colannino</p>

<p>Growing a community around an open source research software effort to the point that there are external maintainers is a sign of huge success - but it makes things way more complicated.  It’s a pain to be the sole maintainer, but at least there’s clarity in decision making.</p>

<p>Here Colannino describes the “Minimum Viable Governance” (MVG) set of template documents for bootstrapping a real open source governance framework.  Some areas - trademark, and antitrust policy(!) - matter less for research computing, but decision making, project charter, code of conduct, and guidelines for contributing are all very relevant.  This is a good starting point as is, or for thinking through the issues.</p>

<p><a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/blogs/adoption-of-llvm-complete-icx.html">Intel C/C++ compilers complete adoption of LLVM</a> - James R Reinders, Intel Software Blog</p>

<p>I didn’t even know this was in the works - the new Intel C/C++ compilers in the oneAPI suite are now based on LLVM.  They’ve changed the name, (icx) so that there’s no confusion and you can have the classic and new compilers installed easily.    This should mean that a lot of tooling becomes available, and development moves more quickly - and it looks like compilation time has significantly improved, and performance on some benchmarks are also better.  Unfortunately it doesn’t sound like intel contributes all their LLVM work upstream.</p>

<p>Fortran is already in progress.</p>

<p><a href="https://mazzo.li/posts/vectorized-atan2.html">Speeding up atan2f by 50x</a> - Francesco Mazzo</p>

<p>The standard glibc atan2f is well optimized, but the authors didn’t need the full of accuracy of atan2 for his application, didn’t need special cases like Inf handled, and did need large batches of operands calculated on at once.   Mazzo’s article goes from defining the approximation he used (including how tuning parameters to minimize maximum error), then vectorization, minimizing type conversion, avoiding NaN-handling (he just wants them to propagate), taking advantage of fused multiply-adds, and finally unrolling to manually vectorize.</p>

<p><a href="https://renato.athaydes.com/posts/how-to-write-fast-rust-code.html">How to write fast Rust Code</a> - Renato Athaydes</p>

<p>Rust is gaining some research software development adherents for new projects that otherwise might be written in something like C++.   Here Athaydes walks us through some gotchas that will be familiar to those of us who have had to write performant code in the past, but with some extra twists due to Rust’s approach to memory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>avoid unnecessary allocations - in this case, due to not understanding rust operators, which can allocate in surprising circumstances to the uninitiated</li>
  <li>avoid unnecessary copies, which can similarly be triggered because of rusts’s lifetimes</li>
  <li>mutation is faster than copy-and-change - pretty familiar, but again rust’s memory rules make this a little less idiomatic</li>
  <li>printing directly to stdout is surprisingly expensive!</li>
</ul>

<p>Athaydes then points to some tools to help, such as a microbenchmarking tool <a href="https://bheisler.github.io/criterion.rs/book/">criterion.rs</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph">flamegraph</a> tool for profiling, and walks through some cases of using those.</p>

<h2 id="research-data-management-and-analysis">Research Data Management and Analysis</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.bitsondisk.com/writing/2021/retire-the-csv/">It’s Time to Retire the CSV</a> - Alex Rasmussen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite this ubiquity and ease of access, CSV is a wretched way to exchange data. The CSV format itself is notoriously inconsistent, with myriad competing and mutually-exclusive formats that often coexist within a single dataset (or, if you’re particularly unlucky, a single file). Exporting a dataset as a CSV robs it of a wealth of metadata that is very hard for the reader to reconstruct accurately, and many programs’ naïve CSV parsers ignore the metadata reconstruction problem entirely as a result. In practice, CSV’s human-readability is more of a liability than an asset.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hear, hear!  CSV - and, I’d argue, other human-readable text formats - were a costly mistake.  Rasmussen itemizes some of the problems - absent metadata, no typing, poor precision - I’d add surprisingly slow to generate (serializing floating point to text is a shockingly time consuming operation!).   Rasmussen suggests Avro, parquet, arrow, HDF5, sqlite, even XML - almost anything else, really.</p>

<p>CSVs are especially bad because they’re used to exchange arbitrary data, but I’d continue the point and say that in research computing we use text-based file formats, instead of carefully defining APIs and allowing a number of back-end storage representations - <em>way</em> too much.  (I’m looking at you, bioinformatics, with your “tab-separated files are a way of life” nonchalance).</p>

<p>Via <a href="https://gist.github.com/seece/97d02d6518db8b9e4c5b81fc686553e2">a response</a>, I see that <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page">W3C had a multi-year effort</a> to try to define standards around CSVs, and, well, it ended in 2016 and this is the first time you’ve heard of it, isn’t it.</p>

It includes information and links to container images that it looks like AMD maintains.</p>

<p>In the first two articles, Morgan and Hemsoth give new architecture announcement from Intel their usual well-researched coverage.</p>

<p>Morgan overs the big picture, the architectural changes coming for Xeon CPUs (“Sapphire Rapids”) and HPC GPUs (“Ponte Vecchio”).  Sapphire Rapids will be based on chiplet “P (performance)-cores” with cores, accelerators, memory controllers, cache, I/O resources, etc., and Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB) links between them tying the whole die together, including access to high-bandwidth memory.</p>

<p>Hemsoth digs into “AMX”, Advanced Matrix Extensions, aimed specifically for AI/ML but which will be useful for more traditional technical computing applications as well.  As with ARM’s Scalable Matrix Extension (SME) announcement (<a href="https://newsletter.researchcomputingteams.org/archive/4b92939b-90ed-487a-932a-0e90d0efc905">#84</a>), this will support small tiles of matrices, but it seems at a quick read to be more fully featured, including for instance a matrix tile add-multiply (C+=A*C).  Hemsoth says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best way for now to think of AMX is that it’s a matrix math overlay for the AVX-512 vector math units.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the third article, Mellor summarizes Intel’s presentation at IEEE Hot Interconnects, covering their off-chip plans, involving Compute Express Link (CXL).   From Mellor, “<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2021/03/25/cxl-and-the-developing-memory-hierarchy/">CXL</a> is based on the coming PCIe Gen-5.0 bus standard to interconnect processors and fast, low-latency peripheral devices.”  As with the origins of Infiniband, the plan is to extend on-node fast access to data and peripherals off-node, providing (so the plan goes) a cluster-wide memory and (with persistent memory like Octane) storage tier.  A slide from the deck outlining the plan (courtesy the Blocks and Files post) is below.</p>

<p><a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2021/08/github-actions-benchmarks/">Is GitHub Actions Suitable for Running Benchmarks?</a> - Jamie Rodríguez-Guerra, Quantsight Labs</p>

<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s Law</a> would suggest, the answer to the headline question is no, but it’s closer than I would have expected.</p>

<p>Rodríguez-Guerra walks us through trying GitHub Actions CI workflows as benchmarking, for a large number of replications of scikit-image benchmarks.  The results are <em>much</em> less all-over-the-place than I would have expected - the standard deviation is 5% - but unless the kinds of per-commit changes you make are routinely expected to cause performance changes »5% that’s probably just too noisy.</p>

<p>So this probably isn’t good news for benchmarking (although in fairness it might be useful in early stages of optimizing code when you really are going for substantial improvements) but it does suggest a pretty decent reliability in terms of run times for large Actions, which is interesting to know about.</p>
