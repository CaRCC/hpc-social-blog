title: Interesting links I clicked this week
---

<p>I watched several really interesting talks from <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas/program">SRECon22 Americas</a> this week, and in particular I&#8217;d like to highlight:</p>




<ul><li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas/presentation/desai">Principled Performance Analytics</a>, Narayan Desai and Brent Bryan from Google. Some interesting thoughts on quantitative analysis of live performance data for monitoring and observability purposes, moving past simple percentile analysis.</li><li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas/presentation/rosenthal">The &#8216;Success&#8217; in SRE is Silent</a>, Casey Rosenthal from Verica.io. Interesting thoughts here on the visibility of reliability, qualitative analysis of systems, and why regulation and certification might not be the right thing for web systems.</li><li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas/presentation/ryan">Building and Running a Diversity-focused Pre-internship program for SRE</a>, from Andrew Ryan at <s>Facebook</s> Meta. Some good lessons-learned here from an early-career internship-like program, in its first year.</li><li><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22americas/presentation/means">Taking the 737 to the Max</a>, Nickolas Means from Sym. A really interesting analysis of the Boeing 737 Max failures from both a technical and cultural perspective, complete with some graph tracing to understand failure modes.</li></ul>



<p>I also ran across some other articles that I&#8217;ve been actively recommending and sharing with friends and colleagues, including:</p>




<ul><li><a href="https://ferd.ca/plato-s-dashboards.html">Plato&#8217;s Dashboards</a>, Fred Hebert at Honeycomb. This article has some great analysis of how easily-measurable metrics are often poor proxies for the information we&#8217;re actually interested in, and discussing qualitative research methods as a way to gain more insight.</li><li><a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2022/05/end-roe-will-bring-about-sea-change-encryption-debate">The End of Roe Will Bring About A Sea Change In The Encryption Debate</a>, Rianna Pfefferkorn from the Stanford Internet Observatory. You should absolutely go read this article, but to sum up: Law enforcement in states than ban abortion is now <em>absolutely</em> part of the threat model that encrypted messaging defends against. No one claiming to be a progressive should be arguing in favor of &#8220;exceptional access&#8221; or other law enforcement access to encryption.</li></ul>
