<h2>What&#8217;s new</h2>



<p>The first thing that&#8217;s new is&#8230; this post! I&#8217;m going to try to do at least a weekly post on the blog now, just a general update and some links. This will <em>hopefully</em> help me get back into the habit of writing on the blog regularly, and maybe inspire me to write a bit more in general.</p>




<span id="more-264"></span>



<p>I was off work this week for the Thanksgiving holiday, and traveled Michigan to visit my parents and my brother&#8217;s family. My mom has been struggling with some pretty major health issues this year, so it was really wonderful and reassuring to get to spend some time with her and my dad. I also finally got to meet my brother&#8217;s three-year-old son, who was born <em>right</em> before the pandemic started, and who I hadn&#8217;t managed to meet up until now.</p>




<p>On the tech-related front, I used this week to take a break from Twitter (mostly), and to be honest&#8230; it was kinda refreshing! I had developed a pretty bad Twitter habit this year, doomscrolling for more time than I like to admit. While I really like Twitter and I&#8217;ve had some nice career boosts from it, it was also a time sink that was not entirely healthy.</p>




<p>Admittedly, that time was somewhat replaced by playing around on the <a href="https://calico.social/ajdecon">Fediverse / Mastodon</a>. But with the lack of algorithmic suggestions, quote tweets, and other means of virality, that network so far feels a lot quieter and less time-consuming than Twitter. Tim Bray has a <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/26/Bye-Twitter">good post</a> up which discusses some of the advantages and pitfalls of federated social media, and I can highly recommend reading that. I&#8217;m still a bit skeptical that it will be a practical &#8220;Twitter replacement&#8221; for most people, but so far I&#8217;m finding it pleasant.</p>




<h2>What I&#8217;m reading</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Nonfiction book: </strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/code-the-hidden-language-of-computer-hardware-and-software-charles-petzold/18465738">Code, Second Edition, by Charles Petzold</a>. This book walks through the process of building a working computer, starting with ideas like Morse code, then working up from logic gates on up. This is technically a re-read, as I read the first edition&#8230; 10+ years ago? But I&#8217;m getting a lot more out of it this time around, and really enjoying it.</li>



<li><strong>Fiction book: </strong><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-spare-man-mary-robinette-kowal/18834426">The Spare Man, by Mary Robinette Kowal</a>. A cozy murder mystery on a luxury cruise to Mars. I&#8217;m only a few chapters in, but already greatly enjoying myself.</li>



<li><a href="https://ferd.ca/hiding-theory-in-practice.html">&#8220;Hiding theory in practice&#8221;, by Fred Hebert</a>. I&#8217;ve been reading a lot about safety engineering and its application to computing lately, but that community can sometimes get off into the weeds about points of theory that don&#8217;t have consensus in the broader computing community. This post has a good discussion of how to use the theory of safety engineering to guide decisions, without requiring that everyone working with you be handed a reading list.</li>



<li><a href="https://cohost.org/mononcqc/post/385225-paper-repentance-as">&#8220;Paper: Repentance as Rebuke: Betrayal and Moral Injury in Safety Engineering&#8221;, also by Fred Hebert</a>. A discussion of <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-022-00412-2">a paper by Dekker <em>et al</em></a> which looks at the aftermath of the 737 MAX air disasters, and the public repentance of some of the engineers who were involved. Go read the post, it&#8217;s great. And I&#8217;m planning to read the original paper this week.</li>



<li><a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2022/11/15/cannon-lake-intels-forgotten-generation/">&#8220;Cannon Lake: Intel&#8217;s Forgotten Generation&#8221;, from <em>Chips and Cheese</em></a>. Really I&#8217;ve been reading a bunch of the technical posts from <em>Chips and Cheese</em> lately, and they&#8217;re doing pretty good analyses of recent hardware. They&#8217;ve definitely earned that spot in my RSS reader.</li>



<li><a href="https://glennklockwood.blogspot.com/2022/11/sc22-recap.html">Glenn K Lockwood&#8217;s &#8220;SC&#8217;22 Recap&#8221;</a>. I was sad to miss Supercomputing this year, though enough folks have come down with COVID that I don&#8217;t really regret the decision. But Glenn wrote up a really interesting recap post, with an interesting new viewpoint now that he&#8217;s working at Microsoft Azure. Among other things, he included a whole section titled <em>The underwhelming</em>, with the opening line &#8220;The biggest deal appears to be that exascale is here, and it turns out that it&#8217;s not that big of a deal.&#8221;</li>
</ul>



<h2>Recent recipes</h2>



<p>Because it was Thanksgiving, I did a lot of cooking this week! I&#8217;m not going to list everything I made, but a few of my favorites were:</p>




<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a23340027/cheesy-garlic-butter-rolls-recipe/">Cheesy Garlic Butter Rolls from Delish</a>: Nothing special, but really tasty.</li>



<li><a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/11/challah-stuffing/">Challah Stuffing from Smitten Kitchen</a>: This recipe was a huge winner, with most of the family coming back for seconds, and then having more the next day for leftovers. It was really good, and is probably what I&#8217;ll make if I ever do stuffing again.</li>



<li><a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/best-challah-egg-bread/">Best Challah from Smitten Kitchen</a>: I baked the bread that went into the stuffing, and it was really tasty on its own! This recipe makes two loaves, and I only needed one for the stuffing. So I also made french toast with it, which worked really nicely.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Pet photos</h2>



<p>Gotta have those pet photos.</p>
